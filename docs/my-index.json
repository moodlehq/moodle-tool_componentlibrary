This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.\n\n  Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and tidy.\n\n{{}}\n\nDismissing\n\nUsing the alert JavaScript plugin, it's possible to dismiss any alert inline. Here's how:\n\nBe sure you've loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap JavaScript.\nAdd a close button and the .alert-dismissible class, which adds extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the close button.\nOn the close button, add the data-dismiss=\"alert\" attribute, which triggers the JavaScript functionality. Be sure to use the `` element with it for proper behavior across all devices.\nTo animate alerts when dismissing them, be sure to add the .fade and .show classes.\n\nYou can see this in action with a live demo:\n\n{{}}\n\n  Holy guacamole! You should check in on some of those fields below.\n\n    &times;\n\n{{}}\n\nJavaScript behavior\n\nTriggers\n\nEnable dismissal of an alert via JavaScript:\n\n{{}}\nvar alertList = document.querySelectorAll('.alert')\nalertList.forEach(function (alert) {\n  new bootstrap.Alert(alert)\n})\n{{}}\n\nOr with data attributes on a button within the alert, as demonstrated above:\n\n{{}}\n\n  &times;\n\n{{}}\n\nNote that closing an alert will remove it from the DOM.\n\nMethods\n\nYou can create an alert instance with the alert constructor, for example:\n\n{{}}\nvar myAlert = document.getElementById('myAlert')\nvar bsAlert = new bootstrap.Alert(myAlert)\n{{}}\n\nThis makes an alert listen for click events on descendant elements which have the data-dismiss=\"alert\" attribute. (Not necessary when using the data-api's auto-initialization.)\n\n      Method\n      Description\n\n        close\n\n        Closes an alert by removing it from the DOM. If the .fade and .show classes are present on the element, the alert will fade out before it is removed.\n\n        dispose\n\n        Destroys an element's alert.\n\n        getInstance\n\n        Static method which allows you to get the alert instance associated to a DOM element, you can use it like this: bootstrap.Alert.getInstance(alert)\n\n{{}}\nvar alertNode = document.querySelector('.alert')\nvar alert = bootstrap.Alert.getInstance(alertNode)\nalert.close()\n{{}}\n\nEvents\n\nBootstrap's alert plugin exposes a few events for hooking into alert functionality.\n\n      Event\n      Description\n\n      close.bs.alert\n\n        Fires immediately when the close instance method is called.\n\n      closed.bs.alert\n\n        Fired when the alert has been closed and CSS transitions have completed.\n\n{{}}\nvar myAlert = document.getElementById('myAlert')\nmyAlert.addEventListener('closed.bs.alert', function () {\n  // do something…\n})\n{{}}\n",

However, you can also use these classes on  or ` elements (though some browsers may apply a slightly different rendering).\n\nWhen using button classes on ` elements that are used to trigger in-page functionality (like collapsing content), rather than linking to new pages or sections within the current page, these links should be given a role=\"button\"` to appropriately convey their purpose to assistive technologies such as screen readers.\n\n{{}}\nLink\nButton\n\n{{}}\n\nOutline buttons\n\nIn need of a button, but not the hefty background colors they bring?

In addition, even in browsers that do support pointer-events: none, keyboard navigation remains unaffected, meaning that sighted keyboard users and users of assistive technologies will still be able to activate these links. So to be safe, add a tabindex=\"-1\"` attribute on these links (to prevent them from receiving keyboard focus) and use custom JavaScript to disable their functionality.\n{{}}\n\nButton plugin\n\nDo more with buttons. Control button states or create groups of buttons for more components like toolbars.\n\nToggle states\n\nAdd data-toggle=\"button\" to toggle a button's active state.

Add data-toggle=\"buttons\" to a .btn-group containing those modified buttons to enable their toggling behavior via JavaScript and add .btn-group-toggle to style the `s within your buttons. Note that you can create single input-powered buttons or groups of them.\n\nThe checked state for these buttons is only updated via click event on the button. If you use another method to update the input—e.g., with ` or by manually applying the input's checked property—you'll need to toggle .active on the ` manually.\n\nNote that pre-checked buttons require you to manually add the .active class to the input's ``.\n\n{{}}\n\n     Checked\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n     Active\n\n     Radio\n\n     Radio\n\n{{}}\n\nMethods\n\nYou can create a button instance with the button constructor, for example:\n\n{{}}\nvar button = document.getElementById('myButton')\nvar bsButton = new bootstrap.Button(button)\n{{}}\n\n      Method\n      Description\n\n        toggle\n\n        Toggles push state.

It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If you're familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.\n\nExample\n\nCards are built with as little markup and styles as possible, but still manage to deliver a ton of control and customization. Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other Bootstrap components. They have no margin by default, so use spacing utilities as needed.\n\nBelow is an example of a basic card with mixed content and a fixed width. Cards have no fixed width to start, so they'll naturally fill the full width of its parent element. This is easily customized with our various sizing options.\n\n{{}}\n\n  {{}}\n\n    Card title\n    Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n    Go somewhere\n\n{{}}\n\nContent types\n\nCards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more. Below are examples of what's supported.\n\nBody\n\nThe building block of a card is the .card-body. Use it whenever you need a padded section within a card.\n\n{{}}\n\n    This is some text within a card body.\n\n{{}}\n\nTitles, text, and links\n\nCard titles are used by adding .card-title to a ` tag. In the same way, links are added and placed next to each other by adding .card-link to an ` tag.\n\nSubtitles are used by adding a .card-subtitle to a ` tag. If the .card-title and the .card-subtitle items are placed in a .card-body` item, the card title and subtitle are aligned nicely.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Card title\n    Card subtitle\n    Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n    Card link\n    Another link\n\n{{}}\n\nImages\n\n.card-img-top places an image to the top of the card.

        "content": "\nHow it works\n\nThe carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators.\n\nIn browsers where the Page Visibility API is supported, the carousel will avoid sliding when the webpage is not visible to the user (such as when the browser tab is inactive, the browser window is minimized, etc.).\n\n{{}}\n{{}}\n{{}}\n\nPlease be aware that nested carousels are not supported, and carousels are generally not compliant with accessibility standards.\n\nExample\n\nCarousels don't automatically normalize slide dimensions. As such, you may need to use additional utilities or custom styles to appropriately size content. While carousels support previous/next controls and indicators, they're not explicitly required. Add and customize as you see fit.\n\nThe .active class needs to be added to one of the slides otherwise the carousel will not be visible. Also be sure to set a unique id on the .carousel for optional controls, especially if you're using multiple carousels on a single page. Control and indicator elements must have a data-target attribute (or href for links) that matches the id of the .carousel element.\n\nSlides only\n\nHere's a carousel with slides only. Note the presence of the .d-block and .w-100 on carousel images to prevent browser default image alignment.\n\n{{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n{{}}\n\nWith controls\n\nAdding in the previous and next controls:\n\n{{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n    Previous\n\n    Next\n\n{{}}\n\nWith indicators\n\nYou can also add the indicators to the carousel, alongside the controls, too.\n\n{{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n    Previous\n\n    Next\n\n{{}}\n\nWith captions\n\nAdd captions to your slides easily with the .carousel-caption element within any .carousel-item. They can be easily hidden on smaller viewports, as shown below, with optional display utilities. We hide them initially with .d-none and bring them back on medium-sized devices with .d-md-block.\n\n{{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n        First slide label\n        Nulla vitae elit libero, a pharetra augue mollis interdum.\n\n      {{}}\n\n        Second slide label\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n\n      {{}}\n\n        Third slide label\n        Praesent commodo cursus magna, vel scelerisque nisl consectetur.\n\n    Previous\n\n    Next\n\n{{}}\n\nCrossfade\n\nAdd .carousel-fade to your carousel to animate slides with a fade transition instead of a slide.\n\n{{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n    Previous\n\n    Next\n\n{{}}\n\nIndividual .carousel-item interval\n\nAdd data-interval=\"\" to a .carousel-item to change the amount of time to delay between automatically cycling to the next item.\n\n{{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n      {{}}\n\n    Previous\n\n    Next\n\n{{}}\n\nUsage\n\nVia data attributes\n\nUse data attributes to easily control the position of the carousel. data-slide accepts the keywords prev or next, which alters the slide position relative to its current position. Alternatively, use data-slide-to to pass a raw slide index to the carousel data-slide-to=\"2\", which shifts the slide position to a particular index beginning with 0.\n\nThe data-ride=\"carousel\" attribute is used to mark a carousel as animating starting at page load. If you don't use data-ride=\"carousel\" to initialize your carousel, you have to initialize it yourself. It cannot be used in combination with (redundant and unnecessary) explicit JavaScript initialization of the same carousel.\n\nVia JavaScript\n\nCall carousel manually with:\n\n{{}}\nvar myCarousel = document.querySelector('#myCarousel')\nvar carousel = new bootstrap.Carousel(myCarousel)\n{{}}\n\nOptions\n\nOptions can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to data-, as in data-interval=\"\".\n\n      Name\n      Type\n      Default\n      Description\n\n      interval\n      number\n      5000\n      The amount of time to delay between automatically cycling an item.

If set to false, hovering over the carousel won't pause it.\n      On touch-enabled devices, when set to \"hover\", cycling will pause on touchend (once the user finished interacting with the carousel) for two intervals, before automatically resuming. Note that this is in addition to the above mouse behavior.\n\n      slide\n      string | boolean\n      false\n      Autoplays the carousel after the user manually cycles the first item.

Returns to the caller before the previous item has been shown (e.g., before the slid.bs.carousel event occurs).\n\n      next\n      Cycles to the next item. Returns to the caller before the next item has been shown (e.g., before the slid.bs.carousel event occurs).\n\n      nextWhenVisible\n      Cycles the carousel to a particular frame (0 based, similar to an array). Returns to the caller before the target item has been shown (e.g., before the slid.bs.carousel event occurs).\n\n      dispose\n      Destroys an element's carousel.\n\n      getInstance\n      Static method which allows you to get the carousel instance associated with a DOM element.\n\nEvents\n\nBootstrap's carousel class exposes two events for hooking into carousel functionality. Both events have the following additional properties:\n\ndirection: The direction in which the carousel is sliding (either \"left\" or \"right\").\nrelatedTarget: The DOM element that is being slid into place as the active item.\nfrom: The index of the current item\nto: The index of the next item\n\nAll carousel events are fired at the carousel itself (i.e. at the ``).\n\n      Event type\n      Description\n\n      slide.bs.carousel\n      Fires immediately when the slide instance method is invoked.\n\n      slid.bs.carousel\n      Fired when the carousel has completed its slide transition.\n\n{{}}\nvar myCarousel = document.getElementById('myCarousel')\n\nmyCarousel.addEventListener('slide.bs.carousel', function () {\n  // do something...\n})\n{{}}\n\nChange transition duration\n\nThe transition duration of .carousel-item can be changed with the $carousel-transition Sass variable before compiling or custom styles if you're using the compiled CSS. If multiple transitions are applied, make sure the transform transition is defined first (eg. transition: transform 2s ease, opacity .5s ease-out).\n",

This attribute explicitly conveys the current state of the collapsible element tied to the control to screen readers and similar assistive technologies. If the collapsible element is closed by default, the attribute on the control element should have a value of aria-expanded=\"false\". If you've set the collapsible element to be open by default using the show class, set aria-expanded=\"true\" on the control instead. The plugin will automatically toggle this attribute on the control based on whether or not the collapsible element has been opened or closed (via JavaScript, or because the user triggered another control element also tied to the same collapsible element). If the control element's HTML element is not a button (e.g., an ` or ), the attribute role=\"button\"` should be added to the element.\n\nIf your control element is targeting a single collapsible element – i.e. the data-target attribute is pointing to an id selector – you should add the aria-controls attribute to the control element, containing the id of the collapsible element. Modern screen readers and similar assistive technologies make use of this attribute to provide users with additional shortcuts to navigate directly to the collapsible element itself.\n\nNote that Bootstrap's current implementation does not cover the various keyboard interactions described in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1 accordion pattern - you will need to include these yourself with custom JavaScript.\n\nUsage\n\nThe collapse plugin utilizes a few classes to handle the heavy lifting:\n\n.collapse hides the content\n.collapse.show shows the content\n.collapsing is added when the transition starts, and removed when it finishes\n\nThese classes can be found in _transitions.scss.\n\nVia data attributes\n\nJust add data-toggle=\"collapse\" and a data-target to the element to automatically assign control of one or more collapsible elements. The data-target attribute accepts a CSS selector to apply the collapse to. Be sure to add the class collapse to the collapsible element. If you'd like it to default open, add the additional class show.\n\nTo add accordion-like group management to a collapsible area, add the data attribute data-parent=\"#selector\". Refer to the demo to see this in action.\n\nVia JavaScript\n\nEnable manually with:\n\n{{}}\nvar collapseElementList = [].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('.collapse'))\nvar collapseList = collapseElementList.map(function (collapseEl) {\n  return new bootstrap.Collapse(collapseEl)\n})\n{{}}\n\nOptions\n\nOptions can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to data-, as in data-parent=\"\".\n\n      Name\n      Type\n      Default\n      Description\n\n      parent\n      selector | jQuery object | DOM element\n      false\n      If parent is provided, then all collapsible elements under the specified parent will be closed when this collapsible item is shown. (similar to traditional accordion behavior - this is dependent on the card class). The attribute has to be set on the target collapsible area.\n\n      toggle\n      boolean\n      true\n      Toggles the collapsible element on invocation\n\nMethods\n\n{{}}\n{{}}\n{{}}\n\nActivates your content as a collapsible element.

        "title": "Dropdowns",
        "content": "\nOverview\n\nDropdowns are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and more. They're made interactive with the included Bootstrap dropdown JavaScript plugin. They're toggled by clicking, not by hovering; this is an intentional design decision.\n\nDropdowns are built on a third party library, Popper.js, which provides dynamic positioning and viewport detection. Be sure to include popper.min.js before Bootstrap's JavaScript or use bootstrap.bundle.min.js / bootstrap.bundle.js which contains Popper.js. Popper.js isn't used to position dropdowns in navbars though as dynamic positioning isn't required.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe WAI ARIA standard defines an actual role=\"menu\" widget, but this is specific to application-like menus which trigger actions or functions. ARIA menus can only contain menu items, checkbox menu items, radio button menu items, radio button groups, and sub-menus.\n\nBootstrap's dropdowns, on the other hand, are designed to be generic and applicable to a variety of situations and markup structures. For instance, it is possible to create dropdowns that contain additional inputs and form controls, such as search fields or login forms. For this reason, Bootstrap does not expect (nor automatically add) any of the role and aria- attributes required for true ARIA menus. Authors will have to include these more specific attributes themselves.\n\nHowever, Bootstrap does add built-in support for most standard keyboard menu interactions, such as the ability to move through individual .dropdown-item elements using the cursor keys and close the menu with the ESC key.\n\nExamples\n\nWrap the dropdown's toggle (your button or link) and the dropdown menu within .dropdown, or another element that declares position: relative;. Dropdowns can be triggered from ` or  elements to better fit your potential needs. The examples shown here use semantic ` elements where appropriate, but custom markup is supported.\n\nSingle button\n\nAny single .btn can be turned into a dropdown toggle with some markup changes. Here's how you can put them to work with either `` elements:\n\n{{}}\n\n    Dropdown button\n\n    Action\n    Another action\n    Something else here\n\n{{}}\n\nAnd with `` elements:\n\n{{}}\n\n    Dropdown link\n\n    Action\n    Another action\n    Something else here\n\n{{}}\n\nThe best part is you can do this with any button variant, too:\n\n    Primary\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Secondary\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Success\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Info\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Warning\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Danger\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n{{}}\n\n    Action\n\n    Action\n    Another action\n    Something else here\n\n    Separated link\n\n{{}}\n\nSplit button\n\nSimilarly, create split button dropdowns with virtually the same markup as single button dropdowns, but with the addition of .dropdown-toggle-split for proper spacing around the dropdown caret.\n\nWe use this extra class to reduce the horizontal padding on either side of the caret by 25% and remove the margin-left that's added for regular button dropdowns. Those extra changes keep the caret centered in the split button and provide a more appropriately sized hit area next to the main button.\n\n    Primary\n\n      Toggle Dropdown\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Secondary\n\n      Toggle Dropdown\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Success\n\n      Toggle Dropdown\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Info\n\n      Toggle Dropdown\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Warning\n\n      Toggle Dropdown\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Danger\n\n      Toggle Dropdown\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n{{}}\n\n  Action\n\n    Toggle Dropdown\n\n    Action\n    Another action\n    Something else here\n\n    Separated link\n\n{{}}\n\nSizing\n\nButton dropdowns work with buttons of all sizes, including default and split dropdown buttons.\n\n        Large button\n\n        Action\n        Another action\n        Something else here\n\n        Separated link\n\n      Large split button\n\n        Toggle Dropdown\n\n        Action\n        Another action\n        Something else here\n\n        Separated link\n\n        Small button\n\n        Action\n        Another action\n        Something else here\n\n        Separated link\n\n      Small split button\n\n        Toggle Dropdown\n\n        Action\n        Another action\n        Something else here\n\n        Separated link\n\n{{}}\n\n    Large button\n\n    ...\n\n    Large split button\n\n    Toggle Dropdown\n\n    ...\n\n    Small button\n\n    ...\n\n    Small split button\n\n    Toggle Dropdown\n\n    ...\n\n{{}}\n\nDirections\n\nDropup\n\nTrigger dropdown menus above elements by adding .dropup to the parent element.\n\n      Dropup\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n      Split dropup\n\n      Toggle Dropdown\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n{{}}\n\n    Dropup\n\n    Split dropup\n\n    Toggle Dropdown\n\n{{}}\n\nDropright\n\nTrigger dropdown menus at the right of the elements by adding .dropright to the parent element.\n\n      Dropright\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n      Split dropright\n\n      Toggle Dropright\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n{{}}\n\n    Dropright\n\n    Split dropright\n\n    Toggle Dropright\n\n{{}}\n\nDropleft\n\nTrigger dropdown menus at the left of the elements by adding .dropleft to the parent element.\n\n      Dropleft\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n        Toggle Dropleft\n\n        Action\n        Another action\n        Something else here\n\n        Separated link\n\n      Split dropleft\n\n{{}}\n\n    Dropleft\n\n      Toggle Dropleft\n\n    Split dropleft\n\n{{}}\n\nMenu items\n\nHistorically dropdown menu contents had to be links, but that's no longer the case with v4.

Add .dropdown-menu-right to a .dropdown-menu to right align the dropdown menu.\n\n{{}}\nHeads up!

The data-toggle=\"dropdown\" attribute is relied on for closing dropdown menus at an application level, so it's a good idea to always use it.\n\n{{}}\nOn touch-enabled devices, opening a dropdown adds empty mouseover handlers to the immediate children of the ` element. This admittedly ugly hack is necessary to work around a quirk in iOS' event delegation, which would otherwise prevent a tap anywhere outside of the dropdown from triggering the code that closes the dropdown. Once the dropdown is closed, these additional empty mouseover` handlers are removed.\n{{}}\n\nVia data attributes\n\nAdd data-toggle=\"dropdown\" to a link or button to toggle a dropdown.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Dropdown trigger\n\n    ...\n\n{{}}\n\nVia JavaScript\n\nCall the dropdowns via JavaScript:\n\n{{}}\nvar dropdownElementList = [].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('.dropdown-toggle'))\nvar dropdownList = dropdownElementList.map(function (dropdownToggleEl) {\n  return new bootstrap.Dropdown(dropdownToggleEl)\n})\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\ndata-toggle=\"dropdown\" still required\n\nRegardless of whether you call your dropdown via JavaScript or instead use the data-api, data-toggle=\"dropdown\" is always required to be present on the dropdown's trigger element.\n{{}}\n\nOptions\n\nOptions can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to data-, as in data-offset=\"\".\n\n      Name\n      Type\n      Default\n      Description\n\n      offset\n      number | string | function\n      0\n\n        Offset of the dropdown relative to its target.\n        When a function is used to determine the offset, it is called with an object containing the offset data as its first argument. The function must return an object with the same structure. The triggering element DOM node is passed as the second argument.\n        For more information refer to Popper.js's offset docs.\n\n      flip\n      boolean\n      true\n      Allow Dropdown to flip in case of an overlapping on the reference element. For more information refer to Popper.js's flip docs.\n\n      boundary\n      string | element\n      'scrollParent'\n      Overflow constraint boundary of the dropdown menu. Accepts the values of 'viewport', 'window', 'scrollParent', or an HTMLElement reference (JavaScript only). For more information refer to Popper.js's preventOverflow docs.\n\n      reference\n      string | element\n      'toggle'\n      Reference element of the dropdown menu. Accepts the values of 'toggle', 'parent', or an HTMLElement reference. For more information refer to Popper.js's referenceObject docs.\n\n      display\n      string\n      'dynamic'\n      By default, we use Popper.js for dynamic positioning. Disable this with static.\n\n      popperConfig\n      null | object\n      null\n      To change Bootstrap's default Popper.js config, see Popper.js's configuration\n\nNote when boundary is set to any value other than 'scrollParent', the style position: static is applied to the .dropdown container.\n\nMethods\n\n      Method\n      Description\n\n      toggle\n\n        Toggles the dropdown menu of a given navbar or tabbed navigation.\n\n      show\n\n        Shows the dropdown menu of a given navbar or tabbed navigation.\n\n      hide\n\n        Hides the dropdown menu of a given navbar or tabbed navigation.\n\n      update\n\n        Updates the position of an element's dropdown.\n\n      dispose\n\n        Destroys an element's dropdown.\n\n      getInstance\n\n        Static method which allows you to get the dropdown instance associated with a DOM element.\n\nEvents\n\nAll dropdown events are fired at the .dropdown-menu's parent element and have a relatedTarget property, whose value is the toggling anchor element.\nhide.bs.dropdown and hidden.bs.dropdown events have a clickEvent property (only when the original Event type is click) that contains an Event Object for the click event.\n\n      Method\n      Description\n\n        show.bs.dropdown\n\n        Fires immediately when the show instance method is called.\n\n        shown.bs.dropdown\n\n        Fired when the dropdown has been made visible to the user and CSS transitions have completed.\n\n        hide.bs.dropdown\n\n        Fires immediately when the hide instance method has been called.\n\n        hidden.bs.dropdown\n\n        Fired when the dropdown has finished being hidden from the user and CSS transitions have completed.\n\n{{}}\nvar myDropdown = document.getElementById('myDropdown')\nmyDropdown.addEventListener('show.bs.dropdown', function () {\n  // do something...\n})\n{{}}\n",

They're positioned over everything else in the document and remove scroll from the `` so that modal content scrolls instead.\nClicking on the modal \"backdrop\" will automatically close the modal.\nBootstrap only supports one modal window at a time. Nested modals aren't supported as we believe them to be poor user experiences.\nModals use position: fixed, which can sometimes be a bit particular about its rendering. Whenever possible, place your modal HTML in a top-level position to avoid potential interference from other elements. You'll likely run into issues when nesting a .modal within another fixed element.\nOnce again, due to position: fixed, there are some caveats with using modals on mobile devices. See our browser support docs for details.\nDue to how HTML5 defines its semantics, the autofocus HTML attribute has no effect in Bootstrap modals. To achieve the same effect, use some custom JavaScript:\n\n{{}}\nvar myModal = document.getElementById('myModal')\nvar myInput = document.getElementById('myInput')\n\nmyModal.addEventListener('shown.bs.modal', function () {\n  myInput.focus()\n})\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n{{}}\n{{}}\n\nKeep reading for demos and usage guidelines.\n\nExamples\n\nModal components\n\nBelow is a static modal example (meaning its position and display have been overridden). Included are the modal header, modal body (required for padding), and modal footer (optional). We ask that you include modal headers with dismiss actions whenever possible, or provide another explicit dismiss action.\n\n          Modal title\n\n            &times;\n\n          Modal body text goes here.\n\n          Close\n          Save changes\n\n{{}}\n\n        Modal title\n\n          &times;\n\n        Modal body text goes here.\n\n        Close\n        Save changes\n\n{{}}\n\nLive demo\n\nToggle a working modal demo by clicking the button below.

Use event.relatedTarget and HTML data-* attributes to vary the contents of the modal depending on which button was clicked.\n\nBelow is a live demo followed by example HTML and JavaScript. For more information, read the modal events docs for details on relatedTarget.\n\n{{}}\nOpen modal for @mdo\nOpen modal for @fat\nOpen modal for @getbootstrap\n\n        New message\n\n          &times;\n\n            Recipient:\n\n            Message:\n\n        Close\n        Send message\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\nvar exampleModal = document.getElementById('exampleModal')\nexampleModal.addEventListener('show.bs.modal', function (event) {\n  // Button that triggered the modal\n  var button = event.relatedTarget\n  // Extract info from data-* attributes\n  var recipient = button.getAttribute('data-whatever')\n  // If necessary, you could initiate an AJAX request here\n  // and then do the updating in a callback.\n  //\n  // Update the modal's content.\n  exampleModal.querySelector('.modal-title').textContent = 'New message to ' + recipient\n  exampleModal.querySelector('.modal-body input').value = recipient\n})\n{{}}\n\nChange animation\n\nThe $modal-fade-transform variable determines the transform state of .modal-dialog before the modal fade-in animation, the $modal-show-transform variable determines the transform of .modal-dialog at the end of the modal fade-in animation.\n\nIf you want for example a zoom-in animation, you can set $modal-fade-transform: scale(.8).\n\nRemove animation\n\nFor modals that simply appear rather than fade in to view, remove the .fade class from your modal markup.\n\n{{}}\n\n  ...\n\n{{}}\n\nDynamic heights\n\nIf the height of a modal changes while it is open, you should call myModal.handleUpdate() to readjust the modal's position in case a scrollbar appears.\n\nAccessibility\n\nBe sure to add role=\"dialog\" and aria-labelledby=\"...\", referencing the modal title, to .modal, and role=\"document\" to the .modal-dialog itself. Additionally, you may give a description of your modal dialog with aria-describedby on .modal.\n\nEmbedding YouTube videos\n\nEmbedding YouTube videos in modals requires additional JavaScript not in Bootstrap to automatically stop playback and more. See this helpful Stack Overflow post for more information.\n\nOptional sizes\n\nModals have three optional sizes, available via modifier classes to be placed on a .modal-dialog. These sizes kick in at certain breakpoints to avoid horizontal scrollbars on narrower viewports.\n\n      Size\n      Class\n      Modal max-width\n\n      Small\n      .modal-sm\n      300px\n\n      Default\n      None\n      500px\n\n      Large\n      .modal-lg\n      800px\n\n      Extra large\n      .modal-xl\n      1140px\n\nOur default modal without modifier class constitutes the \"medium\" size modal.\n\n  Extra large modal\n  Large modal\n  Small modal\n\n{{}}\n\nExtra large modal\n\n      ...\n\nLarge modal\n\n      ...\n\nSmall modal\n\n      ...\n\n{{}}\n\n        Extra large modal\n\n          &times;\n\n        ...\n\n        Large modal\n\n          &times;\n\n        ...\n\n        Small modal\n\n          &times;\n\n        ...\n\nUsage\n\nThe modal plugin toggles your hidden content on demand, via data attributes or JavaScript. It also adds .modal-open to the ` to override default scrolling behavior and generates a .modal-backdrop` to provide a click area for dismissing shown modals when clicking outside the modal.\n\nVia data attributes\n\nActivate a modal without writing JavaScript. Set data-toggle=\"modal\" on a controller element, like a button, along with a data-target=\"#foo\" or href=\"#foo\" to target a specific modal to toggle.\n\n{{}}\nLaunch modal\n{{}}\n\nVia JavaScript\n\nCreate a modal with a single line of JavaScript:\n\n{{}}\nvar myModal = new bootstrap.Modal(document.getElementById('myModal'), options)\n{{}}\n\nOptions\n\nOptions can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript.

Change the container to limit their horizontal width in different ways.\nUse our spacing and flex utility classes for controlling spacing and alignment within navbars.\nNavbars are responsive by default, but you can easily modify them to change that. Responsive behavior depends on our Collapse JavaScript plugin.\nEnsure accessibility by using a ` element or, if using a more generic element such as a , add a role=\"navigation\"` to every navbar to explicitly identify it as a landmark region for users of assistive technologies.\n\n{{}}\n{{}}\n{{}}\n\nRead on for an example and list of supported sub-components.\n\nSupported content\n\nNavbars come with built-in support for a handful of sub-components. Choose from the following as needed:\n\n.navbar-brand for your company, product, or project name.\n.navbar-nav for a full-height and lightweight navigation (including support for dropdowns).\n.navbar-toggler for use with our collapse plugin and other navigation toggling behaviors.\n.form-inline for any form controls and actions.\n.navbar-text for adding vertically centered strings of text.\n.collapse.navbar-collapse for grouping and hiding navbar contents by a parent breakpoint.\n\nHere's an example of all the sub-components included in a responsive light-themed navbar that automatically collapses at the lg (large) breakpoint.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Navbar\n\n          Home (current)\n\n          Link\n\n            Dropdown\n\n            Action\n            Another action\n\n            Something else here\n\n          Disabled\n\n        Search\n\n{{}}\n\nThis example uses color (bg-light) and spacing (my-2, my-lg-0, mr-sm-0, my-sm-0) utility classes.\n\nBrand\n\nThe .navbar-brand can be applied to most elements, but an anchor works best as some elements might require utility classes or custom styles.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Navbar\n\n    Navbar\n\n{{}}\n\nAdding images to the .navbar-brand will likely always require custom styles or utilities to properly size.

This is also a great reminder that vertical alignment utilities can be used to align different sized elements.\n\n{{}}\n\n      Main button\n      Smaller button\n\n{{}}\n\nText\n\nNavbars may contain bits of text with the help of .navbar-text. This class adjusts vertical alignment and horizontal spacing for strings of text.\n\n{{}}\n\n      Navbar text with an inline element\n\n{{}}\n\nMix and match with other components and utilities as needed.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Navbar w/ text\n\n          Home (current)\n\n          Features\n\n          Pricing\n\n        Navbar text with an inline element\n\n{{}}\n\nColor schemes\n\nTheming the navbar has never been easier thanks to the combination of theming classes and background-color utilities. Choose from .navbar-light for use with light background colors, or .navbar-dark for dark background colors. Then, customize with .bg-* utilities.\n\n      Navbar\n\n            Home (current)\n\n            Features\n\n            Pricing\n\n            About\n\n          Search\n\n      Navbar\n\n            Home (current)\n\n            Features\n\n            Pricing\n\n            About\n\n          Search\n\n      Navbar\n\n            Home (current)\n\n            Features\n\n            Pricing\n\n            About\n\n          Search\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\nContainers\n\nAlthough it's not required, you can wrap a navbar in a .container to center it on a page or add one within to only center the contents of a fixed or static top navbar. Note that an inner container is still required.\n\n{{}}\n\n      Navbar\n\n{{}}\n\nUse any of the responsive containers to change how wide the content in your navbar.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Navbar\n\n{{}}\n\nPlacement\n\nUse our position utilities to place navbars in non-static positions. Choose from fixed to the top, fixed to the bottom, or stickied to the top (scrolls with the page until it reaches the top, then stays there). Fixed navbars use position: fixed, meaning they're pulled from the normal flow of the DOM and may require custom CSS (e.g., padding-top on the ``) to prevent overlap with other elements.\n\nAlso note that .sticky-top uses position: sticky, which isn't fully supported in every browser.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Default\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n    Fixed top\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n    Fixed bottom\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n    Sticky top\n\n{{}}\n\nResponsive behaviors\n\nNavbars can utilize .navbar-toggler, .navbar-collapse, and .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl} classes to change when their content collapses behind a button. In combination with other utilities, you can easily choose when to show or hide particular elements.\n\nFor navbars that never collapse, add the .navbar-expand class on the navbar. For navbars that always collapse, don't add any .navbar-expand class.\n\nToggler\n\nNavbar togglers are left-aligned by default, but should they follow a sibling element like a .navbar-brand, they'll automatically be aligned to the far right. Reversing your markup will reverse the placement of the toggler. Below are examples of different toggle styles.\n\nWith no .navbar-brand shown in lowest breakpoint:\n\n{{}}\n\n      Hidden brand\n\n          Home (current)\n\n          Link\n\n          Disabled\n\n        Search\n\n{{}}\n\nWith a brand name shown on the left and toggler on the right:\n\n{{}}\n\n    Navbar\n\n          Home (current)\n\n          Link\n\n          Disabled\n\n        Search\n\n{{}}\n\nWith a toggler on the left and brand name on the right:\n\n{{}}\n\n    Navbar\n\n          Home (current)\n\n          Link\n\n          Disabled\n\n        Search\n\n{{}}\n\nExternal content\n\nSometimes you want to use the collapse plugin to trigger hidden content elsewhere on the page. Because our plugin works on the id and data-target matching, that's easily done!\n\n{{}}\n\n    Collapsed content\n    Toggleable via the navbar brand.\n\n{{}}\n",

        "content": "\nBase nav\n\nNavigation available in Bootstrap share general markup and styles, from the base .nav class to the active and disabled states. Swap modifier classes to switch between each style.\n\nThe base .nav component is built with flexbox and provide a strong foundation for building all types of navigation components. It includes some style overrides (for working with lists), some link padding for larger hit areas, and basic disabled styling.\n\n{{}}\nThe base .nav component does not include any .active state. The following examples include the class, mainly to demonstrate that this particular class does not trigger any special styling.\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n    Active\n\n    Link\n\n    Link\n\n    Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nClasses are used throughout, so your markup can be super flexible. Use `s like above,  if the order of your items is important, or roll your own with a  element. Because the .nav uses display: flex`, the nav links behave the same as nav items would, but without the extra markup.\n\n{{}}\n\n  Active\n  Link\n  Link\n  Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nAvailable styles\n\nChange the style of .navs component with modifiers and utilities. Mix and match as needed, or build your own.\n\nHorizontal alignment\n\nChange the horizontal alignment of your nav with flexbox utilities. By default, navs are left-aligned, but you can easily change them to center or right aligned.\n\nCentered with .justify-content-center:\n\n{{}}\n\n    Active\n\n    Link\n\n    Link\n\n    Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nRight-aligned with .justify-content-end:\n\n{{}}\n\n    Active\n\n    Link\n\n    Link\n\n    Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nVertical\n\nStack your navigation by changing the flex item direction with the .flex-column utility. Need to stack them on some viewports but not others? Use the responsive versions (e.g., .flex-sm-column).\n\n{{}}\n\n    Active\n\n    Link\n\n    Link\n\n    Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nAs always, vertical navigation is possible without ``s, too.\n\n{{}}\n\n  Active\n  Link\n  Link\n  Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nTabs\n\nTakes the basic nav from above and adds the .nav-tabs class to generate a tabbed interface. Use them to create tabbable regions with our tab JavaScript plugin.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Active\n\n    Link\n\n    Link\n\n    Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nPills\n\nTake that same HTML, but use .nav-pills instead:\n\n{{}}\n\n    Active\n\n    Link\n\n    Link\n\n    Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nFill and justify\n\nForce your .nav's contents to extend the full available width one of two modifier classes. To proportionately fill all available space with your .nav-items, use .nav-fill. Notice that all horizontal space is occupied, but not every nav item has the same width.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Active\n\n    Much longer nav link\n\n    Link\n\n    Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nWhen using a `-based navigation, be sure to include .nav-item` on the anchors.\n\n{{}}\n\n  Active\n  Much longer nav link\n  Link\n  Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nFor equal-width elements, use .nav-justified. All horizontal space will be occupied by nav links, but unlike the .nav-fill above, every nav item will be the same width.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Active\n\n    Much longer nav link\n\n    Link\n\n    Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nSimilar to the .nav-fill example using a `-based navigation, be sure to include .nav-item` on the anchors.\n\n{{}}\n\n  Active\n  Much longer nav link\n  Link\n  Disabled\n\n{{}}\nWorking with flex utilities\n\nIf you need responsive nav variations, consider using a series of flexbox utilities. While more verbose, these utilities offer greater customization across responsive breakpoints. In the example below, our nav will be stacked on the lowest breakpoint, then adapt to a horizontal layout that fills the available width starting from the small breakpoint.\n\n{{}}\n\n  Active\n  Longer nav link\n  Link\n  Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nRegarding accessibility\n\nIf you're using navs to provide a navigation bar, be sure to add a role=\"navigation\" to the most logical parent container of the `, or wrap a  element around the whole navigation. Do not add the role to the ` itself, as this would prevent it from being announced as an actual list by assistive technologies.\n\nNote that navigation bars, even if visually styled as tabs with the .nav-tabs class, should not be given role=\"tablist\", role=\"tab\" or role=\"tabpanel\" attributes. These are only appropriate for dynamic tabbed interfaces, as described in the WAI ARIA Authoring Practices. See JavaScript behavior for dynamic tabbed interfaces in this section for an example.\n\nUsing dropdowns\n\nAdd dropdown menus with a little extra HTML and the dropdowns JavaScript plugin.\n\nTabs with dropdowns\n\n{{}}\n\n    Active\n\n    Dropdown\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Link\n\n    Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nPills with dropdowns\n\n{{}}\n\n    Active\n\n    Dropdown\n\n      Action\n      Another action\n      Something else here\n\n      Separated link\n\n    Link\n\n    Disabled\n\n{{}}\n\nJavaScript behavior\n\nUse the tab JavaScript plugin—include it individually or through the compiled bootstrap.js file—to extend our navigational tabs and pills to create tabbable panes of local content, even via dropdown menus.\n\nDynamic tabbed interfaces, as described in the WAI ARIA Authoring Practices, require role=\"tablist\", role=\"tab\", role=\"tabpanel\", and additional aria- attributes in order to convey their structure, functionality and current state to users of assistive technologies (such as screen readers).\n\nNote that dynamic tabbed interfaces should not contain dropdown menus, as this causes both usability and accessibility issues. From a usability perspective, the fact that the currently displayed tab's trigger element is not immediately visible (as it's inside the closed dropdown menu) can cause confusion. From an accessibility point of view, there is currently no sensible way to map this sort of construct to a standard WAI ARIA pattern, meaning that it cannot be easily made understandable to users of assistive technologies.\n\n      Home\n\n      Profile\n\n      Contact\n\n      Raw denim you probably haven't heard of them jean shorts Austin.

Pagination is built with list HTML elements so screen readers can announce the number of available links. Use a wrapping `` element to identify it as a navigation section to screen readers and other assistive technologies.\n\nIn addition, as pages likely have more than one such navigation section, it's advisable to provide a descriptive aria-label for the ` to reflect its purpose. For example, if the pagination component is used to navigate between a set of search results, an appropriate label could be aria-label=\"Search results pages\"`.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Previous\n    1\n    2\n    3\n    Next\n\n{{}}\n\nWorking with icons\n\nLooking to use an icon or symbol in place of text for some pagination links?

        "content": "\nOverview\n\nThings to know when using the popover plugin:\n\nPopovers rely on the 3rd party library Popper.js for positioning. You must include popper.min.js before bootstrap.js or use bootstrap.bundle.min.js / bootstrap.bundle.js which contains Popper.js in order for popovers to work!\nPopovers require the tooltip plugin as a dependency.\nPopovers are opt-in for performance reasons, so you must initialize them yourself.\nZero-length title and content values will never show a popover.\nSpecify container: 'body' to avoid rendering problems in more complex components (like our input groups, button groups, etc).\nTriggering popovers on hidden elements will not work.\nPopovers for .disabled or disabled elements must be triggered on a wrapper element.\nWhen triggered from anchors that wrap across multiple lines, popovers will be centered between the anchors' overall width. Use .text-nowrap on your ``s to avoid this behavior.\nPopovers must be hidden before their corresponding elements have been removed from the DOM.\nPopovers can be triggered thanks to an element inside a shadow DOM.\n\n{{}}\n{{}}\n{{}}\n\nKeep reading to see how popovers work with some examples.\n\nExample: Enable popovers everywhere\n\nOne way to initialize all popovers on a page would be to select them by their data-toggle attribute:\n\n{{}}\nvar popoverTriggerList = [].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('[data-toggle=\"popover\"]'))\nvar popoverList = popoverTriggerList.map(function (popoverTriggerEl) {\n  return new bootstrap.Popover(popoverTriggerEl)\n})\n{{}}\n\nExample: Using the container option\n\nWhen you have some styles on a parent element that interfere with a popover, you'll want to specify a custom container so that the popover's HTML appears within that element instead.\n\n{{}}\nvar popover = new bootstrap.Popover(document.querySelector('.example-popover'), {\n  container: 'body'\n})\n{{}}\n\nExample\n\n{{}}\nClick to toggle popover\n{{}}\n\nFour directions\n\nFour options are available: top, right, bottom, and left aligned.\n\n      Popover on top\n\n      Popover on right\n\n      Popover on bottom\n\n      Popover on left\n\n{{}}\n\n  Popover on top\n\n  Popover on right\n\n  Popover on bottom\n\n  Popover on left\n\n{{}}\n\nDismiss on next click\n\nUse the focus trigger to dismiss popovers on the user's next click of a different element than the toggle element.\n\n{{}}\nSpecific markup required for dismiss-on-next-click\n\nFor proper cross-browser and cross-platform behavior, you must use the ` tag, not the  tag, and you also must include a tabindex` attribute.\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\nDismissible popover\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\nvar popover = new bootstrap.Popover(document.querySelector('.popover-dismiss'), {\n  trigger: 'focus'\n})\n{{}}\n\nDisabled elements\n\nElements with the disabled attribute aren't interactive, meaning users cannot hover or click them to trigger a popover (or tooltip). As a workaround, you'll want to trigger the popover from a wrapper ` or  and override the pointer-events` on the disabled element.\n\nFor disabled popover triggers, you may also prefer data-trigger=\"hover\" so that the popover appears as immediate visual feedback to your users as they may not expect to click on a disabled element.\n\n{{}}\n\n  Disabled button\n\n{{}}\n\nUsage\n\nEnable popovers via JavaScript:\n\n{{}}\nvar exampleEl = document.getElementById('example')\nvar popover = new bootstrap.Popover(exampleEl, options)\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\nMaking popovers work for keyboard and assistive technology users\n\nTo allow keyboard users to activate your popovers, you should only add them to HTML elements that are traditionally keyboard-focusable and interactive (such as links or form controls). Although arbitrary HTML elements (such as `s) can be made focusable by adding the tabindex=\"0\" attribute, this will add potentially annoying and confusing tab stops on non-interactive elements for keyboard users, and most assistive technologies currently do not announce the popover's content in this situation. Additionally, do not rely solely on hover` as the trigger for your popovers, as this will make them impossible to trigger for keyboard users.\n\nWhile you can insert rich, structured HTML in popovers with the html option, we strongly recommend that you avoid adding an excessive amount of content. The way popovers currently work is that, once displayed, their content is tied to the trigger element with the aria-describedby attribute. As a result, the entirety of the popover's content will be announced to assistive technology users as one long, uninterrupted stream.\n\nAdditionally, while it is possible to also include interactive controls (such as form elements or links) in your popover (by adding these elements to the whiteList or allowed attributes and tags), be aware that currently the popover does not manage keyboard focus order. When a keyboard user opens a popover, focus remains on the triggering element, and as the popover usually does not immediately follow the trigger in the document's structure, there is no guarantee that moving forward/pressing TAB will move a keyboard user into the popover itself. In short, simply adding interactive controls to a popover is likely to make these controls unreachable/unusable for keyboard users and users of assistive technologies, or at the very least make for an illogical overall focus order. In these cases, consider using a modal dialog instead.\n{{}}\n\nOptions\n\nOptions can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to data-, as in data-animation=\"\".\n\n{{}}\nNote that for security reasons the sanitize, sanitizeFn and whiteList options cannot be supplied using data attributes.\n{{}}\n\n      Name\n      Type\n      Default\n      Description\n\n      animation\n      boolean\n      true\n      Apply a CSS fade transition to the popover\n\n      container\n      string | element | false\n      false\n\n        Appends the popover to a specific element. Example: container: 'body'. This option is particularly useful in that it allows you to position the popover in the flow of the document near the triggering element - which will prevent the popover from floating away from the triggering element during a window resize.\n\n      content\n      string | element | function\n      ''\n\n        Default content value if data-content attribute isn't present.\n        If a function is given, it will be called with its this reference set to the element that the popover is attached to.\n\n      delay\n      number | object\n      0\n\n        Delay showing and hiding the popover (ms) - does not apply to manual trigger type\n        If a number is supplied, delay is applied to both hide/show\n        Object structure is: delay: { \"show\": 500, \"hide\": 100 }\n\n      html\n      boolean\n      false\n      Insert HTML into the popover.

Then add the data-target attribute with the ID or class of the parent element of any Bootstrap .nav` component.\n\n{{}}\nbody {\n  position: relative;\n}\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n  ...\n\n      ...\n\n  ...\n\n{{}}\n\nVia JavaScript\n\nAfter adding position: relative; in your CSS, call the scrollspy via JavaScript:\n\n{{}}\nvar scrollSpy = new bootstrap.ScrollSpy(document.body, {\n  target: '#navbar-example'\n})\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\nResolvable ID targets required\n\nNavbar links must have resolvable id targets. For example, a home must correspond to something in the DOM like ``.\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\nNon-visible target elements ignored\n\nTarget elements that are not visible will be ignored and their corresponding nav items will never be highlighted.\n{{}}\n\nMethods\n\nrefresh\n\nWhen using scrollspy in conjunction with adding or removing of elements from the DOM, you'll need to call the refresh method like so:\n\n{{}}\nvar dataSpyList = [].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('[data-spy=\"scroll\"]'))\ndataSpyList.forEach(function (dataSpyEl) {\n  bootstrap.ScrollSpy.getInstance(dataSpyEl)\n    .refresh()\n})\n{{}}\n\ndispose\n\nDestroys an element's scrollspy.\n\ngetInstance\n\nStatic method which allows you to get the scrollspy instance associated with a DOM element\n\n{{}}\nvar scrollSpyContentEl = document.getElementById('content')\nvar scrollSpy = bootstrap.ScrollSpy.getInstance(scrollSpyContentEl) // Returns a Bootstrap scrollspy instance\n{{}}\n\nOptions\n\nOptions can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to data-, as in data-offset=\"\".\n\n      Name\n      Type\n      Default\n      Description\n\n      offset\n      number\n      10\n      Pixels to offset from top when calculating position of scroll.\n\n      method\n      string\n      auto\n      Finds which section the spied element is in. auto will choose the best method to get scroll coordinates. offset will use the Element.getBoundingClientRect() method to get scroll coordinates. position will use the HTMLElement.offsetTop and HTMLElement.offsetLeft properties to get scroll coordinates.\n\n      target\n      string\n\n      Specifies element to apply Scrollspy plugin.\n\nEvents\n\n      Event type\n      Description\n\n      activate.bs.scrollspy\n      This event fires on the scroll element whenever a new item becomes activated by the scrollspy.\n\n{{}}\nvar firstScrollSpyEl = document.querySelector('[data-spy=\"scroll\"]')\nfirstScrollSpyEl.addEventListener('activate.bs.scrollspy', function () {\n  // do something...\n})\n{{}}\n",

Toast headers use display: flex, allowing easy alignment of content thanks to our margin and flexbox utilities.\n\nToasts are as flexible as you need and have very little required markup. At a minimum, we require a single element to contain your \"toasted\" content and strongly encourage a dismiss button.\n\n{{}}\n\n    {{}}\n    Bootstrap\n    11 mins ago\n\n      &times;\n\n    Hello, world! This is a toast message.\n\n{{}}\n\nTranslucent\n\nToasts are slightly translucent, too, so they blend over whatever they might appear over. For browsers that support the backdrop-filter CSS property, we'll also attempt to blur the elements under a toast.\n\n{{}}\n\n    {{}}\n    Bootstrap\n    11 mins ago\n\n      &times;\n\n    Hello, world!

Just like this.\n\n    {{}}\n    Bootstrap\n    2 seconds ago\n\n      &times;\n\n    Heads up, toasts will stack automatically\n\n{{}}\n\nPlacement\n\nPlace toasts with custom CSS as you need them. The top right is often used for notifications, as is the top middle. If you're only ever going to show one toast at a time, put the positioning styles right on the .toast.\n\n{{}}\n\n      {{}}\n      Bootstrap\n      11 mins ago\n\n        &times;\n\n      Hello, world!

This is a toast message.\n\n{{}}\n\nAccessibility\n\nToasts are intended to be small interruptions to your visitors or users, so to help those with screen readers and similar assistive technologies, you should wrap your toasts in an aria-live region. Changes to live regions (such as injecting/updating a toast component) are automatically announced by screen readers without needing to move the user's focus or otherwise interrupt the user. Additionally, include aria-atomic=\"true\" to ensure that the entire toast is always announced as a single (atomic) unit, rather than announcing what was changed (which could lead to problems if you only update part of the toast's content, or if displaying the same toast content at a later point in time). If the information needed is important for the process, e.g. for a list of errors in a form, then use the alert component instead of toast.\n\nNote that the live region needs to be present in the markup before the toast is generated or updated. If you dynamically generate both at the same time and inject them into the page, they will generally not be announced by assistive technologies.\n\nYou also need to adapt the role and aria-live level depending on the content. If it's an important message like an error, use role=\"alert\" aria-live=\"assertive\", otherwise use role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\" attributes.\n\nAs the content you're displaying changes, be sure to update the delay timeout to ensure people have enough time to read the toast.\n\n{{}}\n\n  ...\n\n{{}}\n\nWhen using autohide: false, you must add a close button to allow users to dismiss the toast.\n\n{{}}\n\n    {{}}\n    Bootstrap\n    11 mins ago\n\n      &times;\n\n    Hello, world!

You must include popper.min.js before bootstrap.js or use bootstrap.bundle.min.js / bootstrap.bundle.js which contains Popper.js in order for tooltips to work!\nTooltips are opt-in for performance reasons, so you must initialize them yourself.\nTooltips with zero-length titles are never displayed.\nSpecify container: 'body' to avoid rendering problems in more complex components (like our input groups, button groups, etc).\nTriggering tooltips on hidden elements will not work.\nTooltips for .disabled or disabled elements must be triggered on a wrapper element.\nWhen triggered from hyperlinks that span multiple lines, tooltips will be centered. Use white-space: nowrap; on your ``s to avoid this behavior.\nTooltips must be hidden before their corresponding elements have been removed from the DOM.\nTooltips can be triggered thanks to an element inside a shadow DOM.\n\n{{}}\n{{}}\n{{}}\n\nGot all that? Great, let's see how they work with some examples.\n\nExample: Enable tooltips everywhere\n\nOne way to initialize all tooltips on a page would be to select them by their data-toggle attribute:\n\n{{}}\nvar tooltipTriggerList = [].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]'))\nvar tooltipList = tooltipTriggerList.map(function (tooltipTriggerEl) {\n  return new bootstrap.Tooltip(tooltipTriggerEl)\n})\n{{}}\n\nExamples\n\nHover over the links below to see tooltips:\n\n  Tight pants next level keffiyeh you probably haven't heard of them.

To resolve, set the boundary option to anything other than default value, 'scrollParent', such as 'window':\n\n{{}}\nvar exampleEl = document.getElementById('example')\nvar tooltip = new bootstrap.Tooltip(exampleEl, {\n  boundary: 'window'\n})\n{{}}\n{{}}\n\nMarkup\n\nThe required markup for a tooltip is only a data attribute and title on the HTML element you wish to have a tooltip. The generated markup of a tooltip is rather simple, though it does require a position (by default, set to top by the plugin).\n\n{{}}\nMaking tooltips work for keyboard and assistive technology users\n\nYou should only add tooltips to HTML elements that are traditionally keyboard-focusable and interactive (such as links or form controls). Although arbitrary HTML elements (such as `s) can be made focusable by adding the tabindex=\"0\" attribute, this will add potentially annoying and confusing tab stops on non-interactive elements for keyboard users, and most assistive technologies currently do not announce the tooltip in this situation. Additionally, do not rely solely on hover` as the trigger for your tooltip, as this will make your tooltips impossible to trigger for keyboard users.\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\nHover over me\n\n    Some tooltip text!\n\n{{}}\n\nDisabled elements\n\nElements with the disabled attribute aren't interactive, meaning users cannot focus, hover, or click them to trigger a tooltip (or popover). As a workaround, you'll want to trigger the tooltip from a wrapper ` or , ideally made keyboard-focusable using tabindex=\"0\", and override the pointer-events` on the disabled element.\n\n{{}}\n\n  Disabled button\n\n{{}}\n\nOptions\n\nOptions can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to data-, as in data-animation=\"\".\n\n{{}}\nNote that for security reasons the sanitize, sanitizeFn and whiteList options cannot be supplied using data attributes.\n{{}}\n\n      Name\n      Type\n      Default\n      Description\n\n      animation\n      boolean\n      true\n      Apply a CSS fade transition to the tooltip\n\n      container\n      string | element | false\n      false\n\n        Appends the tooltip to a specific element. Example: container: 'body'. This option is particularly useful in that it allows you to position the tooltip in the flow of the document near the triggering element - which will prevent the tooltip from floating away from the triggering element during a window resize.\n\n      delay\n      number | object\n      0\n\n        Delay showing and hiding the tooltip (ms) - does not apply to manual trigger type\n        If a number is supplied, delay is applied to both hide/show\n        Object structure is: delay: { \"show\": 500, \"hide\": 100 }\n\n      html\n      boolean\n      false\n\n        Allow HTML in the tooltip.\n        If true, HTML tags in the tooltip's title will be rendered in the tooltip.

You may pass multiple triggers; separate them with a space.\n        'manual' indicates that the tooltip will be triggered programmatically via the .tooltip('show'), .tooltip('hide') and .tooltip('toggle') methods; this value cannot be combined with any other trigger.\n        'hover' on its own will result in tooltips that cannot be triggered via the keyboard, and should only be used if alternative methods for conveying the same information for keyboard users is present.\n\n      offset\n      number | string | function\n      0\n\n        Offset of the tooltip relative to its target.\n        When a function is used to determine the offset, it is called with an object containing the offset data as its first argument. The function must return an object with the same structure. The triggering element DOM node is passed as the second argument.\n        For more information refer to Popper.js's offset docs.\n\n      fallbackPlacement\n      string | array\n      'flip'\n      Allow to specify which position Popper will use on fallback.

        "title": "Reboot",
        "content": "\nApproach\n\nReboot builds upon Normalize, providing many HTML elements with somewhat opinionated styles using only element selectors. Additional styling is done only with classes. For example, we reboot some ` styles for a simpler baseline and later provide .table, .table-bordered`, and more.\n\nHere are our guidelines and reasons for choosing what to override in Reboot:\n\nUpdate some browser default values to use rems instead of ems for scalable component spacing.\nAvoid margin-top. Vertical margins can collapse, yielding unexpected results. More importantly though, a single direction of margin is a simpler mental model.\nFor easier scaling across device sizes, block elements should use rems for margins.\nKeep declarations of font-related properties to a minimum, using inherit whenever possible.\n\nPage defaults\n\nThe ` and ` elements are updated to provide better page-wide defaults. More specifically:\n\nThe box-sizing is globally set on every element—including ::before and ::after, to border-box. This ensures that the declared width of element is never exceeded due to padding or border.\n  No base font-size is declared on the `, but 16px is assumed (the browser default). font-size: 1rem is applied on the  for easy responsive type-scaling via media queries while respecting user preferences and ensuring a more accessible approach. This browser default can be overridden by modifying the $font-size-root` variable.\nThe ` also sets a global font-family, font-weight, line-height, and color`. This is inherited later by some form elements to prevent font inconsistencies.\nFor safety, the ` has a declared background-color, defaulting to #fff`.\n\nNative font stack\n\nThe default web fonts (Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, and Arial) have been dropped in Bootstrap 4 and replaced with a \"native font stack\" for optimum text rendering on every device and OS. Read more about native font stacks in this Smashing Magazine article.\n\n{{}}\n$font-family-sans-serif:\n  // Safari for macOS and iOS (San Francisco)\n  -apple-system,\n  // Chrome }}\n\nThis font-family is applied to the ` and automatically inherited globally throughout Bootstrap. To switch the global font-family, update $font-family-base` and recompile Bootstrap.\n\nHeadings and paragraphs\n\nAll heading elements—e.g., `—and  are reset to have their margin-top removed. Headings have margin-bottom: .5rem added and paragraphs margin-bottom: 1rem` for easy spacing.\n\n      Heading\n      Example\n\n        {{}}``{{}}\n\n      h1. Bootstrap heading\n\n        {{}}``{{}}\n\n      h2. Bootstrap heading\n\n        {{}}``{{}}\n\n      h3. Bootstrap heading\n\n        {{}}``{{}}\n\n      h4. Bootstrap heading\n\n        {{}}``{{}}\n\n      h5. Bootstrap heading\n\n        {{}}``{{}}\n\n      h6. Bootstrap heading\n\nLists\n\nAll lists—`, , and —have their margin-top removed and a margin-bottom: 1rem. Nested lists have no margin-bottom. We've also reset the padding-left on  and ` elements.\n\n{{}}\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet\nConsectetur adipiscing elit\nInteger molestie lorem at massa\nFacilisis in pretium nisl aliquet\nNulla volutpat aliquam velit\n  Phasellus iaculis neque\n  Purus sodales ultricies\n  Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem\n  Ac tristique libero volutpat at\nFaucibus porta lacus fringilla vel\nAenean sit amet erat nunc\nEget porttitor lorem\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet\nConsectetur adipiscing elit\nInteger molestie lorem at massa\nFacilisis in pretium nisl aliquet\nNulla volutpat aliquam velit\nFaucibus porta lacus fringilla vel\nAenean sit amet erat nunc\nEget porttitor lorem\n{{}}\n\nFor simpler styling, clear hierarchy, and better spacing, description lists have updated margins. `s reset margin-left to 0 and add margin-bottom: .5rem. `s are bolded.\n\n    Description lists\n    A description list is perfect for defining terms.\n    Euismod\n    Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper eget lacinia odio sem.\n    Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus.\n    Malesuada porta\n    Etiam porta sem malesuada magna mollis euismod.\n\nInline code\n\nWrap inline snippets of code with ``. Be sure to escape HTML angle brackets.\n\n{{}}\nFor example, &lt;section&gt; should be wrapped as inline.\n{{}}\n\nCode blocks\n\nUse `s for multiple lines of code. Once again, be sure to escape any angle brackets in the code for proper rendering. The  element is reset to remove its margin-top and use rem units for its margin-bottom`.\n\n{{}}\n&lt;p&gt;Sample text here...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And another line of sample text here...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n{{}}\n\nVariables\n\nFor indicating variables use the `` tag.\n\n{{}}\ny = mx + b\n{{}}\n\nUser input\n\nUse the `` to indicate input that is typically entered via keyboard.\n\n{{}}\nTo switch directories, type cd followed by the name of the directory.\nTo edit settings, press ctrl + ,\n{{}}\n\nSample output\n\nFor indicating sample output from a program use the `` tag.\n\n{{}}\nThis text is meant to be treated as sample output from a computer program.\n{{}}\n\nTables\n\nTables are slightly adjusted to style `s, collapse borders, and ensure consistent text-align throughout. Additional changes for borders, padding, and more come with the .table` class.\n\n      This is an example table, and this is its caption to describe the contents.\n\n        Table heading\n        Table heading\n        Table heading\n        Table heading\n\n        Table cell\n        Table cell\n        Table cell\n        Table cell\n\n        Table cell\n        Table cell\n        Table cell\n        Table cell\n\n        Table cell\n        Table cell\n        Table cell\n        Table cell\n\nForms\n\nVarious form elements have been rebooted for simpler base styles. Here are some of the most notable changes:\n\n``s have no borders, padding, or margin so they can be easily used as wrappers for individual inputs or groups of inputs.\n``s, like fieldsets, have also been restyled to be displayed as a heading of sorts.\n`s are set to display: inline-block to allow margin` to be applied.\n`s, s, s, and s are mostly addressed by Normalize, but Reboot removes their margin and sets line-height: inherit`, too.\n``s are modified to only be resizable vertically as horizontal resizing often \"breaks\" page layout.\n`s and  button elements have cursor: pointer when :not(:disabled)`.\n\nThese changes, and more, are demonstrated below.\n\n    Example legend\n\n      Example input\n\n      Example email\n\n      Example telephone\n\n      Example url\n\n      Example number\n\n      Example search\n\n      Example range\n\n      Example file input\n\n      Example select\n\n        Choose...\n\n          Option 1\n          Option 2\n          Option 3\n\n          Option 4\n          Option 5\n          Option 6\n\n        Check this checkbox\n\n        Option one is this and that\n\n        Option two is something else that's also super long to demonstrate the wrapping of these fancy form controls.\n\n        Option three is disabled\n\n      Example textarea\n\n      Example date\n\n      Example time\n\n      Example password\n\n      Example datetime-local\n\n      Example week\n\n      Example month\n\n      Example color\n\n      Example output\n      100\n\n      Button submit\n\n      Button submit\n\n{{}}\n{{}}\n{{}}\n\nMisc elements\n\nAddress\n\nThe ` element is updated to reset the browser default font-style from italic to normal. line-height is also now inherited, and margin-bottom: 1rem has been added. s are for presenting contact information for the nearest ancestor (or an entire body of work). Preserve formatting by ending lines with `.\n\n    Twitter, Inc.\n    1355 Market St, Suite 900\n    San Francisco, CA 94103\n    P: (123) 456-7890\n\n    Full Name\n    first.last@example.com\n\nBlockquote\n\nThe default margin on blockquotes is 1em 40px, so we reset that to 0 0 1rem for something more consistent with other elements.\n\n    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Borrowing an idea from PureCSS, we improve upon this default by making [hidden] { display: none !important; } to help prevent its display from getting accidentally overridden. While [hidden] isn't natively supported by IE10, the explicit declaration in our CSS gets around that problem.\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\njQuery incompatibility\n\n[hidden] is not compatible with jQuery's $(...).hide() and $(...).show() methods. Therefore, we don't currently especially endorse [hidden] over other techniques for managing the display of elements.\n{{}}\n\nTo merely toggle the visibility of an element, meaning its display is not modified and the element can still affect the flow of the document, use the .invisible class instead.\n",

Bootstrap provides no default styling for the ` element, but there are some powerful browser features that are provided by default.\n\nNew to browser forms?

Additional classes can be used to vary this layout on a per-form basis.\n\nUtilities\n\nMargin utilities are the easiest way to add some structure to forms. They provide basic grouping of labels, controls, optional help text, and form validation messaging. We recommend sticking to margin-bottom utilities, and using a single direction throughout the form for consistency.\n\nFeel free to build your forms however you like, with `s, `s, or nearly any other element.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Example label\n\n    Another label\n\n{{}}\n\nForm grid\n\nMore complex forms can be built using our grid classes.

Also requires the $enable-grid-classes Sass variable to be enabled (on by default).\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\nMore complex layouts can also be created with the grid system.\n\n{{}}\n\n      Email\n\n      Password\n\n    Address\n\n    Address 2\n\n      City\n\n      State\n\n        Choose...\n        ...\n\n      Zip\n\n        Check me out\n\n  Sign in\n\n{{}}\n\nHorizontal form\n\nCreate horizontal forms with the grid by adding the .row class to form groups and using the .col-- classes to specify the width of your labels and controls. Be sure to add .col-form-label to your ``s as well so they're vertically centered with their associated form controls.\n\nAt times, you maybe need to use margin or padding utilities to create that perfect alignment you need. For example, we've removed the padding-top on our stacked radio inputs label to better align the text baseline.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Email\n\n    Password\n\n      Radios\n\n            First radio\n\n            Second radio\n\n            Third disabled radio\n\n    Checkbox\n\n          Example checkbox\n\n      Sign in\n\n{{}}\n\nHorizontal form label sizing\n\nBe sure to use .col-form-label-sm or .col-form-label-lg to your `s or s to correctly follow the size of .form-control-lg and .form-control-sm`.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Email\n\n    Email\n\n    Email\n\n{{}}\n\nColumn sizing\n\nAs shown in the previous examples, our grid system allows you to place any number of .cols within a .row or .form-row. They'll split the available width equally between them. You may also pick a subset of your columns to take up more or less space, while the remaining .cols equally split the rest, with specific column classes like .col-7.\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\nAuto-sizing\n\nThe example below uses a flexbox utility to vertically center the contents and changes .col to .col-auto so that your columns only take up as much space as needed. Put another way, the column sizes itself based on the contents.\n\n{{}}\n\n      Name\n\n      Username\n\n          @\n\n      Preference\n\n        Choose...\n        One\n        Two\n        Three\n\n          Remember me\n\n      Submit\n\n{{}}\n\nYou can then remix that once again with size-specific column classes.\n\n{{}}\n\n      Name\n\n      Username\n\n          @\n\n      Preference\n\n        Choose...\n        One\n        Two\n        Three\n\n          Remember me\n\n      Submit\n\n{{}}\n\nInline forms\n\nUse the .form-inline class to display a series of labels, form controls, and buttons on a single horizontal row. Form controls within inline forms vary slightly from their default states.\n\nControls are display: flex, collapsing any HTML white space and allowing you to provide alignment control with spacing and flexbox utilities.\nControls and input groups receive width: auto to override the Bootstrap default width: 100%.\nControls only appear inline in viewports that are at least 576px wide to account for narrow viewports on mobile devices.\n\nYou may need to manually address the width and alignment of individual form controls with spacing utilities (as shown below). Lastly, be sure to always include a ` with each form control, even if you need to hide it from non-screenreader visitors with .sr-only`.\n\n{{}}\n\n  Name\n\n  Username\n\n      @\n\n  Preference\n\n    Choose...\n    One\n    Two\n    Three\n\n      Remember me\n\n  Submit\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\nAlternatives to hidden labels\n\nAssistive technologies such as screen readers will have trouble with your forms if you don't include a label for every input. For these inline forms, you can hide the labels using the .sr-only class. There are further alternative methods of providing a label for assistive technologies, such as the aria-label, aria-labelledby or title attribute. If none of these are present, assistive technologies may resort to using the placeholder attribute, if present, but note that use of placeholder as a replacement for other labeling methods is not advised.\n{{}}\n",

        "content": "\n{{}}\nWe currently recommend using custom validation styles, as native browser default validation messages are not consistently exposed to assistive technologies in all browsers (most notably, Chrome on desktop and mobile).\n{{}}\n\nHow it works\n\nHere's how form validation works with Bootstrap:\n\nHTML form validation is applied via CSS's two pseudo-classes, :invalid and :valid. It applies to `, , and ` elements.\nBootstrap scopes the :invalid and :valid styles to parent .was-validated class, usually applied to the ``. Otherwise, any required field without a value shows up as invalid on page load. This way, you may choose when to activate them (typically after form submission is attempted).\nTo reset the appearance of the form (for instance, in the case of dynamic form submissions using AJAX), remove the .was-validated class from the `` again after submission.\nAs a fallback, .is-invalid and .is-valid classes may be used instead of the pseudo-classes for server-side validation. They do not require a .was-validated parent class.\nDue to constraints in how CSS works, we cannot (at present) apply styles to a `` that comes before a form control in the DOM without the help of custom JavaScript.\nAll modern browsers support the constraint validation API, a series of JavaScript methods for validating form controls.\nFeedback messages may utilize the browser defaults (different for each browser, and unstylable via CSS) or our custom feedback styles with additional HTML and CSS.\nYou may provide custom validity messages with setCustomValidity in JavaScript.\n\nWith that in mind, consider the following demos for our custom form validation styles, optional server-side classes, and browser defaults.\n\nCustom styles\n\nFor custom Bootstrap form validation messages, you'll need to add the novalidate boolean attribute to your `. This disables the browser default feedback tooltips, but still provides access to the form validation APIs in JavaScript. Try to submit the form below; our JavaScript will intercept the submit button and relay feedback to you. When attempting to submit, you'll see the :invalid and :valid` styles applied to your form controls.\n\nCustom feedback styles apply custom colors, borders, focus styles, and background icons to better communicate feedback. Background icons for `s are only available with .form-select, and not .form-control`.\n\n{{}}\n\n      First name\n\n        Looks good!\n\n      Last name\n\n        Looks good!\n\n      Username\n\n          @\n\n          Please choose a username.\n\n      City\n\n        Please provide a valid city.\n\n      State\n\n        Choose...\n        ...\n\n        Please select a valid state.\n\n      Zip\n\n        Please provide a valid zip.\n\n        Agree to terms and conditions\n\n        You must agree before submitting.\n\n  Submit form\n\n// Example starter JavaScript for disabling form submissions if there are invalid fields\n(function () {\n  'use strict';\n\n  // Fetch all the forms we want to apply custom Bootstrap validation styles to\n  var forms = document.querySelectorAll('.needs-validation');\n\n  // Loop over them and prevent submission\n  Array.prototype.slice.call(forms)\n    .forEach(function (form) {\n      form.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {\n        if (!form.checkValidity()) {\n          event.preventDefault();\n          event.stopPropagation();\n        }\n\n        form.classList.add('was-validated');\n      }, false);\n    });\n})();\n\n{{}}\n\nBrowser defaults\n\nNot interested in custom validation feedback messages or writing JavaScript to change form behaviors? All good, you can use the browser defaults. Try submitting the form below. Depending on your browser and OS, you'll see a slightly different style of feedback.\n\nWhile these feedback styles cannot be styled with CSS, you can still customize the feedback text through JavaScript.\n\n{{}}\n\n      First name\n\n      Last name\n\n      Username\n\n          @\n\n      City\n\n      State\n\n        Choose...\n        ...\n\n      Zip\n\n        Agree to terms and conditions\n\n  Submit form\n\n{{}}\n\nServer side\n\nWe recommend using client-side validation, but in case you require server-side validation, you can indicate invalid and valid form fields with .is-invalid and .is-valid. Note that .invalid-feedback is also supported with these classes.\n\n{{}}\n\n      First name\n\n        Looks good!\n\n      Last name\n\n        Looks good!\n\n      Username\n\n          @\n\n          Please choose a username.\n\n      City\n\n        Please provide a valid city.\n\n      State\n\n        Choose...\n        ...\n\n        Please select a valid state.\n\n      Zip\n\n        Please provide a valid zip.\n\n        Agree to terms and conditions\n\n        You must agree before submitting.\n\n  Submit form\n\n{{}}\n\nSupported elements\n\nValidation styles are available for the following form controls and components:\n\n`s and s with .form-control (including up to one .form-control` in input groups)\n`s with .form-select`\n.form-checks\n.form-file\n\n{{}}\n\n    Textarea\n\n      Please enter a message in the textarea.\n\n    Check this checkbox\n    Example invalid feedback text\n\n    Toggle this radio\n\n    Or toggle this other radio\n    More example invalid feedback text\n\n      Open this select menu\n      One\n      Two\n      Three\n\n    Example invalid select feedback\n\n    Choose file...\n    Example invalid form file feedback\n\n{{}}\n\nTooltips\n\nIf your form layout allows it, you can swap the .{valid|invalid}-feedback classes for .{valid|invalid}-tooltip classes to display validation feedback in a styled tooltip. Be sure to have a parent with position: relative on it for tooltip positioning. In the example below, our column classes have this already, but your project may require an alternative setup.\n\n{{}}\n\n      First name\n\n        Looks good!\n\n      Last name\n\n        Looks good!\n\n      Username\n\n          @\n\n          Please choose a unique and valid username.\n\n      City\n\n        Please provide a valid city.\n\n      State\n\n        Choose...\n        ...\n\n        Please select a valid state.\n\n      Zip\n\n        Please provide a valid zip.\n\n  Submit form\n\n{{}}\n\nCustomizing\n\nValidation states can be customized via Sass with the $form-validation-states map. Located in our _variables.scss file, this Sass map is looped over to generate the default valid/invalid validation states. Included is a nested map for customizing each state's color and icon. While no other states are supported by browsers, those using custom styles can easily add more complex form feedback.\n\nPlease note that we do not recommend customizing these values without also modifying the form-validation-state mixin.\n\n{{}}\n// Sass map from _variables.scss\n// Override this and recompile your Sass to generate different states\n$form-validation-states: map-merge(\n  (\n    \"valid\": (\n      \"color\": $form-feedback-valid-color,\n      \"icon\": $form-feedback-icon-valid\n    ),\n    \"invalid\": (\n      \"color\": $form-feedback-invalid-color,\n      \"icon\": $form-feedback-icon-invalid\n    )\n  ),\n  $form-validation-states\n);\n\n// Loop from _forms.scss\n// Any modifications to the above Sass map will be reflected in your compiled\n// CSS via this loop.\n@each $state, $data in $form-validation-states {\n  @include form-validation-state($state, map-get($data, color), map-get($data, icon));\n}\n{{}}\n",

        "content": "\nBootstrap provides an easy-to-use framework of ready-made styles, layout tools, and interactive components, allowing developers to create websites and applications that are visually appealing, functionally rich, and accessible out of the box.\n\nOverview and Limitations\n\nThe overall accessibility of any project built with Bootstrap depends in large part on the author's markup, additional styling, and scripting they've included. However, provided that these have been implemented correctly, it should be perfectly possible to create websites and applications with Bootstrap that fulfill WCAG 2.0 (A/AA/AAA), Section 508 and similar accessibility standards and requirements.\n\nStructural markup\n\nBootstrap's styling and layout can be applied to a wide range of markup structures. This documentation aims to provide developers with best practice examples to demonstrate the use of Bootstrap itself and illustrate appropriate semantic markup, including ways in which potential accessibility concerns can be addressed.\n\nInteractive components\n\nBootstrap's interactive components—such as modal dialogs, dropdown menus and custom tooltips—are designed to work for touch, mouse and keyboard users. Through the use of relevant WAI-ARIA roles and attributes, these components should also be understandable and operable using assistive technologies (such as screen readers).\n\nBecause Bootstrap's components are purposely designed to be fairly generic, authors may need to include further ARIA roles and attributes, as well as JavaScript behavior, to more accurately convey the precise nature and functionality of their component. This is usually noted in the documentation.\n\nColor contrast\n\nMost colors that currently make up Bootstrap's default palette—used throughout the framework for things such as button variations, alert variations, form validation indicators—lead to insufficient color contrast (below the recommended WCAG 2.0 color contrast ratio of 4.5:1) when used against a light background. Authors will need to manually modify/extend these default colors to ensure adequate color contrast ratios.\n\nVisually hidden content\n\nContent which should be visually hidden, but remain accessible to assistive technologies such as screen readers, can be styled using the .sr-only class. This can be useful in situations where additional visual information or cues (such as meaning denoted through the use of color) need to also be conveyed to non-visual users.\n\n{{}}\n\n  Danger:\n  This action is not reversible\n\n{{}}\n\nFor visually hidden interactive controls, such as traditional \"skip\" links, use the .sr-only-focusable class. This will ensure that the control becomes visible once focused (for sighted keyboard users). Watch out, since Bootstrap 5 the .sr-only-focusable class may not be used in combination with the .sr-only class.\n\n{{}}\nSkip to main content\n{{}}\n\nReduced motion\n\nBootstrap includes support for the prefers-reduced-motion media feature. In browsers/environments that allow the user to specify their preference for reduced motion, most CSS transition effects in Bootstrap (for instance, when a modal dialog is opened or closed, or the sliding animation in carousels) will be disabled.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0\nThe A11Y Project\nMDN accessibility documentation\nTenon.io Accessibility Checker\nColor Contrast Analyser (CCA)\n\"HTML Codesniffer\" bookmarklet for identifying accessibility issues\n",

On Windows, we support Internet Explorer 11 / Microsoft Edge.\n\nAlternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko, whether directly or via the platform's web view API, are not explicitly supported. However, Bootstrap should (in most cases) display and function correctly in these browsers as well. More specific support information is provided below.\n\nWe use Autoprefixer to handle intended browser support via CSS prefixes, which uses Browserslist to manage these browser versions. Consult their documentation for how to integrate these tools into your projects.\n\nMobile devices\n\nGenerally speaking, Bootstrap supports the latest versions of each major platform's default browsers.

Please be aware that some CSS3 properties and HTML5 elements are not fully supported in IE10, or require prefixed properties for full functionality. Visit Can I use... for details on browser support of CSS3 and HTML5 features. If you require IE8-9 support, use Bootstrap 3.\n\nModals and dropdowns on mobile\n\nOverflow and scrolling\n\nSupport for overflow: hidden; on the ` element is quite limited in iOS and Android. To that end, when you scroll past the top or bottom of a modal in either of those devices' browsers, the ` content will begin to scroll. See Chrome bug #175502 (fixed in Chrome v40) and WebKit bug #153852.\n\niOS text fields and scrolling\n\nAs of iOS 9.2, while a modal is open, if the initial touch of a scroll gesture is within the boundary of a textual ` or a , the ` content underneath the modal will be scrolled instead of the modal itself. See WebKit bug #153856.\n\nNavbar Dropdowns\n\nThe .dropdown-backdrop element isn't used on iOS in the nav because of the complexity of z-indexing. Thus, to close dropdowns in navbars, you must directly click the dropdown element (or any other element which will fire a click event in iOS).\n\nBrowser zooming\n\nPage zooming inevitably presents rendering artifacts in some components, both in Bootstrap and the rest of the web. Depending on the issue, we may be able to fix it (search first and then open an issue if need be). However, we tend to ignore these as they often have no direct solution other than hacky workarounds.\n\nValidators\n\nIn order to provide the best possible experience to old and buggy browsers, Bootstrap uses CSS browser hacks in several places to target special CSS to certain browser versions in order to work around bugs in the browsers themselves. These hacks understandably cause CSS validators to complain that they are invalid. In a couple places, we also use bleeding-edge CSS features that aren't yet fully standardized, but these are used purely for progressive enhancement.\n\nThese validation warnings don't matter in practice since the non-hacky portion of our CSS does fully validate and the hacky portions don't interfere with the proper functioning of the non-hacky portion, hence why we deliberately ignore these particular warnings.\n\nOur HTML docs likewise have some trivial and inconsequential HTML validation warnings due to our inclusion of a workaround for a certain Firefox bug.\n",

        "uri": "/bootstrap/getting-started/theming",
        "title": "Theming Bootstrap",
        "content": "\nIntroduction\n\nIn Bootstrap 3, theming was largely driven by variable overrides in LESS, custom CSS, and a separate theme stylesheet that we included in our dist files. With some effort, one could completely redesign the look of Bootstrap 3 without touching the core files. Bootstrap 4 provides a familiar, but slightly different approach.\n\nNow, theming is accomplished by Sass variables, Sass maps, and custom CSS. There's no more dedicated theme stylesheet; instead, you can enable the built-in theme to add gradients, shadows, and more.\n\nSass\n\nUtilize our source Sass files to take advantage of variables, maps, mixins, and more. In our build we've increased the Sass rounding precision to 6 (by default it's 5) to prevent issues with browser rounding.\n\nFile structure\n\nWhenever possible, avoid modifying Bootstrap's core files. For Sass, that means creating your own stylesheet that imports Bootstrap so you can modify and extend it. Assuming you're using a package manager like npm, you'll have a file structure that looks like this:\n\n{{}}\nyour-project/\n├── scss\n│   └── custom.scss\n└── node_modules/\n    └── bootstrap\n        ├── js\n        └── scss\n{{}}\n\nIf you've downloaded our source files and aren't using a package manager, you'll want to manually setup something similar to that structure, keeping Bootstrap's source files separate from your own.\n\n{{}}\nyour-project/\n├── scss\n│   └── custom.scss\n└── bootstrap/\n    ├── js\n    └── scss\n{{}}\n\nImporting\n\nIn your custom.scss, you'll import Bootstrap's source Sass files. You have two options: include all of Bootstrap, or pick the parts you need. We encourage the latter, though be aware there are some requirements and dependencies across our components. You also will need to include some JavaScript for our plugins.\n\n{{}}\n// Custom.scss\n// Option A: Include all of Bootstrap\n\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n// Custom.scss\n// Option B: Include parts of Bootstrap\n\n// Required\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions\";\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables\";\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins\";\n\n// Optional\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/reboot\";\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/type\";\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/images\";\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/code\";\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/grid\";\n{{}}\n\nWith that setup in place, you can begin to modify any of the Sass variables and maps in your custom.scss. You can also start to add parts of Bootstrap under the // Optional section as needed. We suggest using the full import stack from our bootstrap.scss file as your starting point.\n\nVariable defaults\n\nEvery Sass variable in Bootstrap 4 includes the !default flag allowing you to override the variable's default value in your own Sass without modifying Bootstrap's source code. Copy and paste variables as needed, modify their values, and remove the !default flag. If a variable has already been assigned, then it won't be re-assigned by the default values in Bootstrap.\n\nYou will find the complete list of Bootstrap's variables in scss/_variables.scss. Some variables are set to null, these variables don't output the property unless they are overridden in your configuration.\n\nVariable overrides within the same Sass file can come before or after the default variables. However, when overriding across Sass files, your overrides must come before you import Bootstrap's Sass files.\n\nHere's an example that changes the background-color and color for the `` when importing and compiling Bootstrap via npm:\n\n{{}}\n// Your variable overrides\n$body-bg: #000;\n$body-color: #111;\n\n// Bootstrap and its default variables\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";\n{{}}\n\nRepeat as necessary for any variable in Bootstrap, including the global options below.\n\nMaps and loops\n\nBootstrap 4 includes a handful of Sass maps, key value pairs that make it easier to generate families of related CSS. We use Sass maps for our colors, grid breakpoints, and more. Just like Sass variables, all Sass maps include the !default flag and can be overridden and extended.\n\nSome of our Sass maps are merged into empty ones by default. This is done to allow easy expansion of a given Sass map, but comes at the cost of making removing items from a map slightly more difficult.\n\nModify map\n\nAll variables in the $theme-colors map are defined as standalone variables. To modify an existing color in our $theme-colors map, add the following to your custom Sass file:\n\n{{}}\n$primary: #0074d9;\n$danger: #ff4136;\n{{}}\n\nLater on, theses variables are set in Bootstrap's $theme-colors map:\n\n{{}}\n$theme-colors: (\n  \"primary\": $primary,\n  \"danger\": $danger\n);\n{{}}\n\nAdd to map\n\nTo add a new color to $theme-colors, add the new key and value:\n\n{{}}\n$theme-colors: (\n  \"custom-color\": #900\n);\n{{}}\n\nRemove from map\n\nTo remove colors from $theme-colors, or any other map, use map-remove. Be aware you must insert it between our requirements and options:\n\n{{}}\n// Required\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions\";\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables\";\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins\";\n\n$theme-colors: map-remove($theme-colors, \"info\", \"light\", \"dark\");\n\n// Optional\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/root\";\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/reboot\";\n@import \"../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/type\";\n...\n{{}}\n\nRequired keys\n\nBootstrap assumes the presence of some specific keys within Sass maps as we used and extend these ourselves. As you customize the included maps, you may encounter errors where a specific Sass map's key is being used.\n\nFor example, we use the primary, success, and danger keys from $theme-colors for links, buttons, and form states. Replacing the values of these keys should present no issues, but removing them may cause Sass compilation issues. In these instances, you'll need to modify the Sass code that makes use of those values.\n\nFunctions\n\nIn Bootstrap 5, we've dropped the color(), theme-color() and gray() functions because the values are also available as standalone variables. So instead of using theme-color(\"primary\"), you can now just use the $primary variable.\n\n{{}}\n.custom-element {\n  color: $gray-100;\n  background-color: $dark;\n}\n{{}}\n\nWe also have a function for getting a particular level of color. Negative level values will lighten the color, while higher levels will darken.\n\n{{}}\n@function color-level($color: $primary, $level: 0) {\n  $color-base: if($level > 0, #000, #fff);\n  $level: abs($level);\n\n  @return mix($color-base, $color, $level * $theme-color-interval);\n}\n{{}}\n\nIn practice, you'd call the function and pass in two parameters: the name of the color from $theme-colors (e.g., primary or danger) and a numeric level.\n\n{{}}\n.custom-element {\n  color: color-level($primary, -10);\n}\n{{}}\n\nColor contrast\n\nAn additional function we include in Bootstrap is the color contrast function, color-yiq. It utilizes the YIQ color space to automatically return a light (#fff) or dark (#111) contrast color based on the specified base color. This function is especially useful for mixins or loops where you're generating multiple classes.\n\nFor example, to generate color swatches from our $theme-colors map:\n\n{{}}\n@each $color, $value in $theme-colors {\n  .swatch-#{$color} {\n    color: color-yiq($value);\n  }\n}\n{{}}\n\nIt can also be used for one-off contrast needs:\n\n{{}}\n.custom-element {\n  color: color-yiq(#000); // returns color: #fff\n}\n{{}}\n\nYou can also specify a base color with our color map functions:\n\n{{}}\n.custom-element {\n  color: color-yiq($dark); // returns color: #fff\n}\n{{}}\n\nEscape SVG\n\nWe use the escape-svg function to escape the ` and #` characters for SVG background images. These characters need to be escaped to properly render the background images in IE.\n\nAdd and Subtract functions\n\nWe use the add and subtract functions to wrap the CSS calc function. The primary purpose of these functions is to avoid errors when a \"unitless\" 0 value is passed into a calc expression. Expressions like calc(10px - 0) will return an error in all browsers, despite being mathematically correct.\n\nExample where the calc is valid:\n\n{{}}\n$border-radius: .25rem;\n$border-width: 1px;\n\n.element {\n  // Output calc(.25rem - 1px) is valid\n  border-radius: calc($border-radius - $border-width);\n}\n\n.element {\n  // Output the same calc(.25rem - 1px) as above\n  border-radius: subtract($border-radius, $border-width);\n}\n{{}}\n\nExample where the calc is invalid:\n\n{{}}\n$border-radius: .25rem;\n$border-width: 0;\n\n.element {\n  // Output calc(.25rem - 0) is invalid\n  border-radius: calc($border-radius - $border-width);\n}\n\n.element {\n  // Output .25rem\n  border-radius: subtract($border-radius, $border-width);\n}\n{{}}\n\nSass options\n\nCustomize Bootstrap 4 with our built-in custom variables file and easily toggle global CSS preferences with new $enable-* Sass variables. Override a variable's value and recompile with npm run test as needed.\n\nYou can find and customize these variables for key global options in Bootstrap's scss/_variables.scss file.\n\n| Variable                                     | Values                             | Description                                                                            |\n| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| $spacer                                    | 1rem (default), or any value > 0 | Specifies the default spacer value to programmatically generate our spacer utilities. |\n| $enable-rounded                            | true (default) or false        | Enables predefined border-radius styles on various components. |\n| $enable-shadows                            | true or false (default)        | Enables predefined box-shadow styles on various components. |\n| $enable-gradients                          | true or false (default)        | Enables predefined gradients via background-image styles on various components. |\n| $enable-transitions                        | true (default) or false        | Enables predefined transitions on various components. |\n| $enable-prefers-reduced-motion-media-query | true (default) or false        | Enables the prefers-reduced-motion media query, which suppresses certain animations/transitions based on the users' browser/operating system preferences. |\n| $enable-grid-classes                       | true (default) or false        | Enables the generation of CSS classes for the grid system (e.g., .container, .row, .col-md-1, etc.). |\n| $enable-caret                              | true (default) or false        | Enables pseudo element caret on .dropdown-toggle. |\n| $enable-pointer-cursor-for-buttons         | true (default) or false        | Add \"hand\" cursor to non-disabled button elements. |\n| $enable-rfs                                | true (default)  or false       | Globally enables RFS. |\n| $enable-validation-icons                   | true (default) or false        | Enables background-image icons within textual inputs and some custom forms for validation states. |\n| $enable-deprecation-messages               | true or false (default)        | Set to true to show warnings when using any of the deprecated mixins and functions that are planned to be removed in v5. |\n\nColor\n\nMany of Bootstrap's various components and utilities are built through a series of colors defined in a Sass map. This map can be looped over in Sass to quickly generate a series of rulesets.\n\nAll colors\n\nAll colors available in Bootstrap 5, are available as Sass variables and a Sass map in scss/_variables.scss file. To avoid increased file sizes, we do not create classes for each of these variables.\n\nSass cannot programmatically generate variables, so we must manually create them ourselves. We specify the midpoint value (500) and use custom color functions to tint (lighten) or shade (darken) our colors via Sass's mix() color function. Using mix() is not the same as lighten() and darken()—the former blends the specified color with white or black, while the latter only adjusts the lightness value of each color. The result is a much more complete suite of colors, as shown in this CodePen demo.\n\nOur tint-color() and shade-color() functions use mix() alongside our $theme-color-interval variable, which specifies a stepped percentage value for each mixed color we need. See the scss/functions.scss and scss/variables.scss files for the full source code.\n\n  {{}}\n  {{- range $color := $.Site.Data.colors }}\n    {{- if (and (not (eq $color.name \"white\")) (not (eq $color.name \"gray\")) (not (eq $color.name \"gray-dark\"))) }}\n\n        ${{ $color.name }}\n        {{ $color.hex }}\n\n      {{ range (seq 100 100 900) }}\n      ${{ $color.name }}-{{ . }}\n      {{ end }}\n\n    {{ end -}}\n  {{ end -}}\n  {{}}\n\nHere's how you can use these in your Sass:\n\n{{}}\n.alpha { color: $purple; }\n.beta {\n  color: $yellow-300;\n  background-color: $indigo-900;\n}\n{{}}\n\nColor utility classes are also available for setting color and background-color.\n\n{{}}\nIn the future, we'll aim to provide Sass maps and variables for shades of each color as we've done with the grayscale colors below.\n{{}}\n\nTheme colors\n\nWe use a subset of all colors to create a smaller color palette for generating color schemes, also available as Sass variables and a Sass map in Bootstrap's scss/_variables.scss file.\n\n  {{}}\n  {{- range (index $.Site.Data \"theme-colors\") }}\n\n      {{ .name | title }}\n\n  {{ end -}}\n  {{}}\n\nGrays\n\nAn expansive set of gray variables and a Sass map in scss/_variables.scss for consistent shades of gray across your project. Note that these are \"cool grays\", which tend towards a subtle blue tone, rather than neutral grays.\n\n    {{}}\n    {{- range $.Site.Data.grays }}\n      {{ .name }}\n    {{ end -}}\n  {{}}\n\nWithin scss/_variables.scss, you'll find Bootstrap's color variables and Sass map. Here's an example of the $colors Sass map:\n\n{{}}\n$colors: (\n  \"blue\": $blue,\n  \"indigo\": $indigo,\n  \"purple\": $purple,\n  \"pink\": $pink,\n  \"red\": $red,\n  \"orange\": $orange,\n  \"yellow\": $yellow,\n  \"green\": $green,\n  \"teal\": $teal,\n  \"cyan\": $cyan,\n  \"white\": $white,\n  \"gray\": $gray-600,\n  \"gray-dark\": $gray-800\n) !default;\n{{}}\n\nAdd, remove, or modify values within the map to update how they're used in many other components. Unfortunately at this time, not every component utilizes this Sass map. Future updates will strive to improve upon this. Until then, plan on making use of the ${color} variables and this Sass map.\n\nComponents\n\nMany of Bootstrap's components and utilities are built with @each loops that iterate over a Sass map. This is especially helpful for generating variants of a component by our $theme-colors and creating responsive variants for each breakpoint. As you customize these Sass maps and recompile, you'll automatically see your changes reflected in these loops.\n\nModifiers\n\nMany of Bootstrap's components are built with a base-modifier class approach. This means the bulk of the styling is contained to a base class (e.g., .btn) while style variations are confined to modifier classes (e.g., .btn-danger). These modifier classes are built from the $theme-colors map to make customizing the number and name of our modifier classes.\n\nHere are two examples of how we loop over the $theme-colors map to generate modifiers to the .alert component and all our .bg-* background utilities.\n\n{{}}\n// Generate alert modifier classes\n@each $color, $value in $theme-colors {\n  .alert-#{$color} {\n    @include alert-variant(color-level($color, -10), color-level($color, -9), color-level($color, 6));\n  }\n}\n\n// Generate .bg-* color utilities\n@each $color, $value in $theme-colors {\n  @include bg-variant('.bg-#{$color}', $value);\n}\n{{}}\n\nResponsive\n\nThese Sass loops aren't limited to color maps, either. You can also generate responsive variations of your components or utilities. Take for example our responsive text alignment utilities where we mix an @each loop for the $grid-breakpoints Sass map with a media query include.\n\n{{}}\n@each $breakpoint in map-keys($grid-breakpoints) {\n  @include media-breakpoint-up($breakpoint) {\n    $infix: breakpoint-infix($breakpoint, $grid-breakpoints);\n\n    .text#{$infix}-left   { text-align: left !important; }\n    .text#{$infix}-right  { text-align: right !important; }\n    .text#{$infix}-center { text-align: center !important; }\n  }\n}\n{{}}\n\nShould you need to modify your $grid-breakpoints, your changes will apply to all the loops iterating over that map.\n\nCSS variables\n\nBootstrap 4 includes around two dozen CSS custom properties (variables) in its compiled CSS. These provide easy access to commonly used values like our theme colors, breakpoints, and primary font stacks when working in your browser's Inspector, a code sandbox, or general prototyping.\n\nAvailable variables\n\nHere are the variables we include (note that the :root is required). They're located in our _root.scss file.\n\n{{}}\n{{}}\n{{- $css := readFile \"hugo/dist/css/bootstrap.css\" -}}\n{{- $match := findRE \":root {(*)}\" $css 1 -}}\n\n{{- if (eq (len $match) 0) -}}\n{{- errorf \"Got no matches for :root in %q!\" $.Page.Path -}}\n{{- end -}}\n\n{{- index $match 0 -}}\n\n{{}}\n{{}}\n\nExamples\n\nCSS variables offer similar flexibility to Sass's variables, but without the need for compilation before being served to the browser. For example, here we're resetting our page's font and link styles with CSS variables.\n\n{{}}\nbody {\n  font: 1rem/1.5 var(--font-family-sans-serif);\n}\na {\n  color: var(--blue);\n}\n{{}}\n",

        "content": "\nHow it works\n\nBootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It's built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look at how the grid comes together.\n\nNew to or unfamiliar with flexbox? Read this CSS Tricks flexbox guide for background, terminology, guidelines, and code snippets.\n\n{{}}\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n{{}}\n\nThe above example creates three equal-width columns on small, medium, large, and extra large devices using our predefined grid classes. Those columns are centered in the page with the parent .container.\n\nBreaking it down, here's how it works:\n\nContainers provide a means to center and horizontally pad your site's contents. Use .container for a responsive pixel width or .container-fluid for width: 100% across all viewport and device sizes.\nRows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins. This way, all the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side.\nIn a grid layout, content must be placed within columns and only columns may be immediate children of rows.\nThanks to flexbox, grid columns without a specified width will automatically layout as equal width columns. For example, four instances of .col-sm will each automatically be 25% wide from the small breakpoint and up. See the auto-layout columns section for more examples.\nColumn classes indicate the number of columns you'd like to use out of the possible 12 per row. So, if you want three equal-width columns across, you can use .col-4.\nColumn widths are set in percentages, so they're always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.\nColumns have horizontal padding to create the gutters between individual columns, however, you can remove the margin from rows and padding from columns with .no-gutters on the .row.\nTo make the grid responsive, there are five grid breakpoints, one for each responsive breakpoint: all breakpoints (extra small), small, medium, large, and extra large.\nGrid breakpoints are based on minimum width media queries, meaning they apply to that one breakpoint and all those above it (e.g., .col-sm-4 applies to small, medium, large, and extra large devices, but not the first xs breakpoint).\nYou can use predefined grid classes (like .col-4) or Sass mixins for more semantic markup.\n\nBe aware of the limitations and bugs around flexbox, like the inability to use some HTML elements as flex containers.\n\nGrid options\n\nWhile Bootstrap uses ems or rems for defining most sizes, pxs are used for grid breakpoints and container widths. This is because the viewport width is in pixels and does not change with the font size.\n\nSee how aspects of the Bootstrap grid system work across multiple devices with a handy table.\n\n        Extra small\n        &lt;576px\n\n        Small\n        &ge;576px\n\n        Medium\n        &ge;768px\n\n        Large\n        &ge;992px\n\n        Extra large\n        &ge;1200px\n\n      Container max-width\n      None (auto)\n      540px\n      720px\n      960px\n      1140px\n\n      Class prefix\n      .col-\n      .col-sm-\n      .col-md-\n      .col-lg-\n      .col-xl-\n\nof columns\n      12\n\n      Gutter width\n      30px (15px on each side of a column)\n\n      Nestable\n      Yes\n\n      Column ordering\n      Yes\n\nAuto-layout columns\n\nUtilize breakpoint-specific column classes for easy column sizing without an explicit numbered class like .col-sm-6.\n\nEqual-width\n\nFor example, here are two grid layouts that apply to every device and viewport, from xs to xl. Add any number of unit-less classes for each breakpoint you need and every column will be the same width.\n\n{{}}\n\n      1 of 2\n\n      2 of 2\n\n      1 of 3\n\n      2 of 3\n\n      3 of 3\n\n{{}}\n\nEqual-width multi-line\n\nCreate equal-width columns that span multiple lines by inserting a .w-100 where you want the columns to break to a new line. Make the breaks responsive by mixing .w-100 with some responsive display utilities.\n\nThere was a Safari flexbox bug that prevented this from working without an explicit flex-basis or border. There are workarounds for older browser versions, but they shouldn't be necessary if your target browsers don't fall into the buggy versions.\n\n{{}}\n\n    col\n    col\n\n    col\n    col\n\n{{}}\n\nSetting one column width\n\nAuto-layout for flexbox grid columns also means you can set the width of one column and have the sibling columns automatically resize around it. You may use predefined grid classes (as shown below), grid mixins, or inline widths. Note that the other columns will resize no matter the width of the center column.\n\n{{}}\n\n      1 of 3\n\n      2 of 3 (wider)\n\n      3 of 3\n\n      1 of 3\n\n      2 of 3 (wider)\n\n      3 of 3\n\n{{}}\n\nVariable width content\n\nUse col-{breakpoint}-auto classes to size columns based on the natural width of their content.\n\n{{}}\n\n      1 of 3\n\n      Variable width content\n\n      3 of 3\n\n      1 of 3\n\n      Variable width content\n\n      3 of 3\n\n{{}}\n\nResponsive classes\n\nBootstrap's grid includes five tiers of predefined classes for building complex responsive layouts. Customize the size of your columns on extra small, small, medium, large, or extra large devices however you see fit.\n\nAll breakpoints\n\nFor grids that are the same from the smallest of devices to the largest, use the .col and .col-* classes. Specify a numbered class when you need a particularly sized column; otherwise, feel free to stick to .col.\n\n{{}}\n\n    col\n    col\n    col\n    col\n\n    col-8\n    col-4\n\n{{}}\n\nStacked to horizontal\n\nUsing a single set of .col-sm-* classes, you can create a basic grid system that starts out stacked and becomes horizontal at the small breakpoint (sm).\n\n{{}}\n\n    col-sm-8\n    col-sm-4\n\n    col-sm\n    col-sm\n    col-sm\n\n{{}}\n\nMix and match\n\nDon't want your columns to simply stack in some grid tiers? Use a combination of different classes for each tier as needed. See the example below for a better idea of how it all works.\n\n{{}}\n\n    .col-md-8\n    .col-6 .col-md-4\n\n    .col-6 .col-md-4\n    .col-6 .col-md-4\n    .col-6 .col-md-4\n\n    .col-6\n    .col-6\n\n{{}}\n\nGutters\n\nGutters can be responsively adjusted by breakpoint-specific padding and negative margin utility classes. To change the gutters in a given row, pair a negative margin utility on the .row and matching padding utilities on the .cols. The .container or .container-fluid parent may need to be adjusted too to avoid unwanted overflow, using again matching padding utility.\n\nHere's an example of customizing the Bootstrap grid at the large (lg) breakpoint and above. We've increased the .col padding with .px-lg-5, counteracted that with .mx-lg-n5 on the parent .row and then adjusted the .container wrapper with .px-lg-5.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Custom column padding\n    Custom column padding\n\n{{}}\n\nRow columns\n\nUse the responsive .row-cols- classes to quickly set the number of columns that best render your content and layout. Whereas normal .col- classes apply to the individual columns (e.g., .col-md-4), the row columns classes are set on the parent .row as a shortcut.\n\nUse these row columns classes to quickly create basic grid layouts or to control your card layouts.\n\n{{}}\n\n    Column\n    Column\n    Column\n    Column\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n    Column\n    Column\n    Column\n    Column\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n    Column\n    Column\n    Column\n    Column\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n    Column\n    Column\n    Column\n    Column\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n    Column\n    Column\n    Column\n    Column\n\n{{}}\n\nYou can also use the accompanying Sass mixin, row-cols():\n\n{{}}\n.element {\n  // Three columns to start\n  @include row-cols(3);\n\n  // Five columns from medium breakpoint up\n  @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {\n    @include row-cols(5);\n  }\n}\n{{}}\n\nAlignment\n\nUse flexbox alignment utilities to vertically and horizontally align columns. Internet Explorer 10-11 do not support vertical alignment of flex items when the flex container has a min-height as shown below. See Flexbugs #3 for more details.\n\nVertical alignment\n\n{{}}\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n      One of three columns\n\n{{}}\n\nHorizontal alignment\n\n{{}}\n\n      One of two columns\n\n      One of two columns\n\n      One of two columns\n\n      One of two columns\n\n      One of two columns\n\n      One of two columns\n\n      One of two columns\n\n      One of two columns\n\n      One of two columns\n\n      One of two columns\n\n{{}}\n\nNo gutters\n\nThe gutters between columns in our predefined grid classes can be removed with .no-gutters. This removes the negative margins from .row and the horizontal padding from all immediate children columns.\n\nHere's the source code for creating these styles. Note that column overrides are scoped to only the first children columns and are targeted via attribute selector. While this generates a more specific selector, column padding can still be further customized with spacing utilities.\n\nNeed an edge-to-edge design? Drop the parent .container or .container-fluid.\n\n{{}}\n.no-gutters {\n  margin-right: 0;\n  margin-left: 0;\n\n  > .col,\n  > [class*=\"col-\"] {\n    padding-right: 0;\n    padding-left: 0;\n  }\n}\n{{}}\n\nIn practice, here's how it looks. Note you can continue to use this with all other predefined grid classes (including column widths, responsive tiers, reorders, and more).\n\n{{}}\n\n  .col-sm-6 .col-md-8\n  .col-6 .col-md-4\n\n{{}}\n\nColumn wrapping\n\nIf more than 12 columns are placed within a single row, each group of extra columns will, as one unit, wrap onto a new line.\n\n{{}}\n\n    .col-9\n    .col-4Since 9 + 4 = 13 &gt; 12, this 4-column-wide div gets wrapped onto a new line as one contiguous unit.\n    .col-6Subsequent columns continue along the new line.\n\n{{}}\n\nColumn breaks\n\nBreaking columns to a new line in flexbox requires a small hack: add an element with width: 100% wherever you want to wrap your columns to a new line. Normally this is accomplished with multiple .rows, but not every implementation method can account for this.\n\n{{}}\n\n    .col-6 .col-sm-3\n    .col-6 .col-sm-3\n\n    .col-6 .col-sm-3\n    .col-6 .col-sm-3\n\n{{}}\n\nYou may also apply this break at specific breakpoints with our responsive display utilities.\n\n{{}}\n\n    .col-6 .col-sm-4\n    .col-6 .col-sm-4\n\n    .col-6 .col-sm-4\n    .col-6 .col-sm-4\n\n{{}}\n\nReordering\n\nOrder classes\n\nUse .order- classes for controlling the visual order of your content. These classes are responsive, so you can set the order by breakpoint (e.g., .order-1.order-md-2). Includes support for 1 through 5 across all five grid tiers.\n\n{{}}\n\n      First in DOM, no order applied\n\n      Second in DOM, with a larger order\n\n      Third in DOM, with an order of 1\n\n{{}}\n\nThere are also responsive .order-first and .order-last classes that change the order of an element by applying order: -1 and order: 6, respectively. These classes can also be intermixed with the numbered .order-* classes as needed.\n\n{{}}\n\n      First in DOM, ordered last\n\n      Second in DOM, unordered\n\n      Third in DOM, ordered first\n\n{{}}\n\nOffsetting columns\n\nYou can offset grid columns in two ways: our responsive .offset- grid classes and our margin utilities. Grid classes are sized to match columns while margins are more useful for quick layouts where the width of the offset is variable.\n\nOffset classes\n\nMove columns to the right using .offset-md- classes. These classes increase the left margin of a column by ` columns. For example, .offset-md-4 moves .col-md-4` over four columns.\n\n{{}}\n\n    .col-md-4\n    .col-md-4 .offset-md-4\n\n    .col-md-3 .offset-md-3\n    .col-md-3 .offset-md-3\n\n    .col-md-6 .offset-md-3\n\n{{}}\n\nIn addition to column clearing at responsive breakpoints, you may need to reset offsets.\n\n{{}}\n\n    .col-sm-5 .col-md-6\n    .col-sm-5 .offset-sm-2 .col-md-6 .offset-md-0\n\n    .col-sm-6 .col-md-5 .col-lg-6\n    .col-sm-6 .col-md-5 .offset-md-2 .col-lg-6 .offset-lg-0\n\n{{}}\n\nMargin utilities\n\nWith the move to flexbox in v4, you can use margin utilities like .mr-auto to force sibling columns away from one another.\n\n{{}}\n\n    .col-md-4\n    .col-md-4 .ml-auto\n\n    .col-md-3 .ml-md-auto\n    .col-md-3 .ml-md-auto\n\n    .col-auto .mr-auto\n    .col-auto\n\n{{}}\n\nNesting\n\nTo nest your content with the default grid, add a new .row and set of .col-sm- columns within an existing .col-sm- column. Nested rows should include a set of columns that add up to 12 or fewer (it is not required that you use all 12 available columns).\n\n{{}}\n\n      Level 1: .col-sm-9\n\n          Level 2: .col-8 .col-sm-6\n\n          Level 2: .col-4 .col-sm-6\n\n{{}}\n\nSass mixins\n\nWhen using Bootstrap's source Sass files, you have the option of using Sass variables and mixins to create custom, semantic, and responsive page layouts. Our predefined grid classes use these same variables and mixins to provide a whole suite of ready-to-use classes for fast responsive layouts.\n\nVariables\n\nVariables and maps determine the number of columns, the gutter width, and the media query point at which to begin floating columns. We use these to generate the predefined grid classes documented above, as well as for the custom mixins listed below.\n\n{{}}\n$grid-columns:      12;\n$grid-gutter-width: 30px;\n\n$grid-breakpoints: (\n  // Extra small screen / phone\n  xs: 0,\n  // Small screen / phone\n  sm: 576px,\n  // Medium screen / tablet\n  md: 768px,\n  // Large screen / desktop\n  lg: 992px,\n  // Extra large screen / wide desktop\n  xl: 1200px\n);\n\n$container-max-widths: (\n  sm: 540px,\n  md: 720px,\n  lg: 960px,\n  xl: 1140px\n);\n{{}}\n\nMixins\n\nMixins are used in conjunction with the grid variables to generate semantic CSS for individual grid columns.\n\n{{}}\n// Creates a wrapper for a series of columns\n@include make-row();\n\n// Make the element grid-ready (applying everything but the width)\n@include make-col-ready();\n@include make-col($size, $columns: $grid-columns);\n\n// Get fancy by offsetting, or changing the sort order\n@include make-col-offset($size, $columns: $grid-columns);\n{{}}\n\nExample usage\n\nYou can modify the variables to your own custom values, or just use the mixins with their default values. Here's an example of using the default settings to create a two-column layout with a gap between.\n\n{{}}\n.example-container {\n  @include make-container();\n  // Make sure to define this width after the mixin to override\n  // width: 100% generated by make-container()\n  width: 800px;\n}\n\n.example-row {\n  @include make-row();\n}\n\n.example-content-main {\n  @include make-col-ready();\n\n  @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {\n    @include make-col(6);\n  }\n  @include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {\n    @include make-col(8);\n  }\n}\n\n.example-content-secondary {\n  @include make-col-ready();\n\n  @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {\n    @include make-col(6);\n  }\n  @include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {\n    @include make-col(4);\n  }\n}\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\n    Main content\n    Secondary content\n\n{{}}\n\nCustomizing the grid\n\nUsing our built-in grid Sass variables and maps, it's possible to completely customize the predefined grid classes. Change the number of tiers, the media query dimensions, and the container widths—then recompile.\n\nColumns and gutters\n\nThe number of grid columns can be modified via Sass variables. $grid-columns is used to generate the widths (in percent) of each individual column while $grid-gutter-width sets the width for the column gutters.\n\n{{}}\n$grid-columns: 12 !default;\n$grid-gutter-width: 30px !default;\n{{}}\n\nGrid tiers\n\nMoving beyond the columns themselves, you may also customize the number of grid tiers. If you wanted just four grid tiers, you'd update the $grid-breakpoints and $container-max-widths to something like this:\n\n{{}}\n$grid-breakpoints: (\n  xs: 0,\n  sm: 480px,\n  md: 768px,\n  lg: 1024px\n);\n\n$container-max-widths: (\n  sm: 420px,\n  md: 720px,\n  lg: 960px\n);\n{{}}\n\nWhen making any changes to the Sass variables or maps, you'll need to save your changes and recompile. Doing so will output a brand new set of predefined grid classes for column widths, offsets, and ordering. Responsive visibility utilities will also be updated to use the custom breakpoints. Make sure to set grid values in px (not rem, em, or %).\n",

Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.\n\nBootstrap comes with three different containers:\n\n.container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint\n.container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints\n.container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint\n\nThe table below illustrates how each container's max-width compares to the original .container and .container-fluid across each breakpoint.\n\n        Extra small\n        &lt;576px\n\n        Small\n        &ge;576px\n\n        Medium\n        &ge;768px\n\n        Large\n        &ge;992px\n\n        Extra large\n        &ge;1200px\n\n      .container\n      100%\n      540px\n      720px\n      960px\n      1140px\n\n      .container-sm\n      100%\n      540px\n      720px\n      960px\n      1140px\n\n      .container-md\n      100%\n      100%\n      720px\n      960px\n      1140px\n\n      .container-lg\n      100%\n      100%\n      100%\n      960px\n      1140px\n\n      .container-xl\n      100%\n      100%\n      100%\n      100%\n      1140px\n\n      .container-fluid\n      100%\n      100%\n      100%\n      100%\n      100%\n\nAll-in-one\n\nOur default .container class is a responsive, fixed-width container, meaning its max-width changes at each breakpoint.\n\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n\nFluid\n\nUse .container-fluid for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.\n\n{{}}\n\n  ...\n\n{{}}\n\nResponsive\n\nResponsive containers are new in Bootstrap v4.4. They allow you to specify a class that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher breakpoints. For example, .container-sm is 100% wide to start until the sm breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with md, lg, and xl.\n\n{{}}\n100% wide until small breakpoint\n100% wide until medium breakpoint\n100% wide until large breakpoint\n100% wide until extra large breakpoint\n{{}}\n\nResponsive breakpoints\n\nSince Bootstrap is developed to be mobile first, we use a handful of media queries to create sensible breakpoints for our layouts and interfaces. These breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport changes.\n\nBootstrap primarily uses the following media query ranges—or breakpoints—in our source Sass files for our layout, grid system, and components.\n\n{{}}\n// Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)\n// No media query for xs since this is the default in Bootstrap\n\n// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)\n@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }\n\n// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)\n@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }\n\n// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)\n@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }\n\n// Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)\n@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }\n{{}}\n\nSince we write our source CSS in Sass, all our media queries are available via Sass mixins:\n\n{{}}\n// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it's effectively @media (min-width: 0) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(md) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(lg) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-up(xl) { ... }\n\n// Example: Hide starting at min-width: 0, and then show at the sm breakpoint\n.custom-class {\n  display: none;\n}\n@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {\n  .custom-class {\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n{{}}\n\nWe occasionally use media queries that go in the other direction (the given screen size or smaller):\n\n{{}}\n// Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)\n@media (max-width: 575.98px) { ... }\n\n// Small devices (landscape phones, less than 768px)\n@media (max-width: 767.98px) { ... }\n\n// Medium devices (tablets, less than 992px)\n@media (max-width: 991.98px) { ... }\n\n// Large devices (desktops, less than 1200px)\n@media (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }\n\n// Extra large devices (large desktops)\n// No media query since the extra-large breakpoint has no upper bound on its width\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\n{{}}\n{{}}\n\nOnce again, these media queries are also available via Sass mixins:\n\n{{}}\n@include media-breakpoint-down(xs) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-down(sm) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-down(md) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-down(lg) { ... }\n// No media query necessary for xl breakpoint as it has no upper bound on its width\n\n// Example: Style from medium breakpoint and down\n@include media-breakpoint-down(md) {\n  .custom-class {\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n{{}}\n\nThere are also media queries and mixins for targeting a single segment of screen sizes using the minimum and maximum breakpoint widths.\n\n{{}}\n// Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)\n@media (max-width: 575.98px) { ... }\n\n// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)\n@media (min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 767.98px) { ... }\n\n// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)\n@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991.98px) { ... }\n\n// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)\n@media (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }\n\n// Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)\n@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }\n{{}}\n\nThese media queries are also available via Sass mixins:\n\n{{}}\n@include media-breakpoint-only(xs) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(sm) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(lg) { ... }\n@include media-breakpoint-only(xl) { ... }\n{{}}\n\nSimilarly, media queries may span multiple breakpoint widths:\n\n{{}}\n// Example\n// Apply styles starting from medium devices and up to extra large devices\n@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }\n{{}}\n\nThe Sass mixin for targeting the same screen size range would be:\n\n{{}}\n@include media-breakpoint-between(md, xl) { ... }\n{{}}\n\nZ-index\n\nSeveral Bootstrap components utilize z-index, the CSS property that helps control layout by providing a third axis to arrange content. We utilize a default z-index scale in Bootstrap that's been designed to properly layer navigation, tooltips and popovers, modals, and more.\n\nThese higher values start at an arbitrary number, high and specific enough to ideally avoid conflicts. We need a standard set of these across our layered components—tooltips, popovers, navbars, dropdowns, modals—so we can be reasonably consistent in the behaviors. There's no reason we couldn't have used 100+ or 500+.\n\nWe don't encourage customization of these individual values; should you change one, you likely need to change them all.\n\n{{}}\n$zindex-dropdown:          1000 !default;\n$zindex-sticky:            1020 !default;\n$zindex-fixed:             1030 !default;\n$zindex-modal-backdrop:    1040 !default;\n$zindex-modal:             1050 !default;\n$zindex-popover:           1060 !default;\n$zindex-tooltip:           1070 !default;\n{{}}\n\nTo handle overlapping borders within components (e.g., buttons and inputs in input groups), we use low single digit z-index values of 1, 2, and 3 for default, hover, and active states. On hover/focus/active, we bring a particular element to the forefront with a higher z-index value to show their border over the sibling elements.\n",

Most of our components are built with flexbox enabled.\n\nShould you need to add display: flex to an element, do so with .d-flex or one of the responsive variants (e.g., .d-sm-flex). You'll need this class or display value to allow the use of our extra flexbox utilities for sizing, alignment, spacing, and more.\n\nMargin and padding\n\nUse the margin and padding spacing utilities to control how elements and components are spaced and sized. Bootstrap 4 includes a five-level scale for spacing utilities, based on a 1rem value default $spacer variable. Choose values for all viewports (e.g., .mr-3 for margin-right: 1rem), or pick responsive variants to target specific viewports (e.g., .mr-md-3 for margin-right: 1rem starting at the md breakpoint).\n\nToggle visibility\n\nWhen toggling display isn't needed, you can toggle the visibility of an element with our visibility utilities.

Custom utility groups can added like this:\n\n$utilities: (\n  \"opacity\": (\n    property: opacity,\n    values: (\n      0: 0,\n      25: .25,\n      50: .5,\n      100: 1,\n    )\n  )\n );\n\nOutput:\n\n.opacity-0 {\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n.opacity-25 {\n  opacity: .25;\n}\n.opacity-75 {\n  opacity: .75;\n}\n.opacity-100 {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n\nChanging the class prefix\n\nWith the class option, the class prefix can be changed:\n\n$utilities: (\n  \"opacity\": (\n    property: opacity,\n    class: o,\n    values: (\n      0: 0,\n      25: .25,\n      50: .5,\n      100: 1,\n    )\n  )\n );\n\nOutput:\n\n.o-0 {\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n.o-25 {\n  opacity: .25;\n}\n.o-75 {\n  opacity: .75;\n}\n.o-100 {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n\nResponsive utilities\n\nWith the responsive option, responsive utility classes can be generated:\n\n$utilities: (\n  \"opacity\": (\n    property: opacity,\n    responsive: true,\n    values: (\n      0: 0,\n      25: .25,\n      50: .5,\n      100: 1,\n    )\n  )\n );\n\nOutput:\n\n.opacity-0 {\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n.opacity-25 {\n  opacity: .25;\n}\n.opacity-75 {\n  opacity: .75;\n}\n.opacity-100 {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n@media (min-width: 576px) {\n  .opacity-sm-0 {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n  .opacity-sm-25 {\n    opacity: .25;\n  }\n  .opacity-sm-75 {\n    opacity: .75;\n  }\n  .opacity-sm-100 {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n}\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\n  .opacity-md-0 {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n  .opacity-md-25 {\n    opacity: .25;\n  }\n  .opacity-md-75 {\n    opacity: .75;\n  }\n  .opacity-md-100 {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n}\n@media (min-width: 992px) {\n  .opacity-lg-0 {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n  .opacity-lg-25 {\n    opacity: .25;\n  }\n  .opacity-lg-75 {\n    opacity: .75;\n  }\n  .opacity-lg-100 {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n}\n@media (min-width: 1200px) {\n  .opacity-xl-0 {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n  .opacity-xl-25 {\n    opacity: .25;\n  }\n  .opacity-xl-75 {\n    opacity: .75;\n  }\n  .opacity-xl-100 {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n}\n\nChanging utilities\n\nOverriding excising utilities is possible by using the same key. For example if you want more responsive overflow\nutility classes you can do this:\n\n$utilities: (\n  \"overflow\": (\n    responsive: true,\n    property: overflow,\n    values: visible hidden scroll auto,\n  ),\n);\n\nPrint utilities\n\nEnabling the print option will also generate utility classes for print.\n\n$utilities: (\n  \"opacity\": (\n    property: opacity,\n    class: o,\n    print: true,\n    values: (\n      0: 0,\n      25: .25,\n      50: .5,\n      100: 1,\n    )\n  )\n );\n\nOutput:\n\n.o-0 {\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n.o-25 {\n  opacity: .25;\n}\n.o-75 {\n  opacity: .75;\n}\n.o-100 {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n\n@media print {\n  .o-print-0 {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n  .o-print-25 {\n    opacity: .25;\n  }\n  .o-print-75 {\n    opacity: .75;\n  }\n  .o-print-100 {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n}\n\nRemoving utilities\n\nUtilities can also be removed by changing the group key to null:\n\n$utilities: (\n  \"float\": null,\n);\n",

        "content": "\nHow it works\n\nChange the value of the display property with our responsive display utility classes. We purposely support only a subset of all possible values for display. Classes can be combined for various effects as you need.\n\nNotation\n\nDisplay utility classes that apply to all breakpoints, from xs to xl, have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes are applied from min-width: 0; and up, and thus are not bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.\n\nAs such, the classes are named using the format:\n\n.d-{value} for xs\n.d-{breakpoint}-{value} for sm, md, lg, and xl.\n\nWhere value is one of:\n\nnone\ninline\ninline-block\nblock\ntable\ntable-cell\ntable-row\nflex\ninline-flex\n\nThe display values can be altered by changing the $displays variable and recompiling the SCSS.\n\nThe media queries effect screen widths with the given breakpoint or larger. For example, .d-lg-none sets display: none; on both lg and xl screens.\n\nExamples\n\n{{}}\nd-inline\nd-inline\n{{}}\n\n{{}}\nd-block\nd-block\n{{}}\n\nHiding elements\n\nFor faster mobile-friendly development, use responsive display classes for showing and hiding elements by device. Avoid creating entirely different versions of the same site, instead hide elements responsively for each screen size.\n\nTo hide elements simply use the .d-none class or one of the .d-{sm,md,lg,xl}-none classes for any responsive screen variation.\n\nTo show an element only on a given interval of screen sizes you can combine one .d--none class with a .d--* class, for example .d-none .d-md-block .d-xl-none will hide the element for all screen sizes except on medium and large devices.\n\n      Screen size\n      Class\n\n      Hidden on all\n      .d-none\n\n      Hidden only on xs\n      .d-none .d-sm-block\n\n      Hidden only on sm\n      .d-sm-none .d-md-block\n\n      Hidden only on md\n      .d-md-none .d-lg-block\n\n      Hidden only on lg\n      .d-lg-none .d-xl-block\n\n      Hidden only on xl\n      .d-xl-none\n\n      Visible on all\n      .d-block\n\n      Visible only on xs\n      .d-block .d-sm-none\n\n      Visible only on sm\n      .d-none .d-sm-block .d-md-none\n\n      Visible only on md\n      .d-none .d-md-block .d-lg-none\n\n      Visible only on lg\n      .d-none .d-lg-block .d-xl-none\n\n      Visible only on xl\n      .d-none .d-xl-block\n\n{{}}\nhide on lg and wider screens\nhide on screens smaller than lg\n{{}}\n\nDisplay in print\n\nChange the display value of elements when printing with our print display utility classes.

        "content": "\nHow it works\n\nAssign responsive-friendly margin or padding values to an element or a subset of its sides with shorthand classes. Includes support for individual properties, all properties, and vertical and horizontal properties. Classes are built from a default Sass map ranging from .25rem to 3rem.\n\nNotation\n\nSpacing utilities that apply to all breakpoints, from xs to xl, have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes are applied from min-width: 0 and up, and thus are not bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.\n\nThe classes are named using the format {property}{sides}-{size} for xs and {property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size} for sm, md, lg, and xl.\n\nWhere property is one of:\n\nm - for classes that set margin\np - for classes that set padding\n\nWhere sides is one of:\n\nt - for classes that set margin-top or padding-top\nb - for classes that set margin-bottom or padding-bottom\nl - for classes that set margin-left or padding-left\nr - for classes that set margin-right or padding-right\nx - for classes that set both -left and -right\ny - for classes that set both -top and -bottom\nblank - for classes that set a margin or padding on all 4 sides of the element\n\nWhere size is one of:\n\n0 - for classes that eliminate the margin or padding by setting it to 0\n1 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .25\n2 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .5\n3 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer\n4 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 1.5\n5 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 3\nauto - for classes that set the margin to auto\n\n(You can add more sizes by adding entries to the $spacers Sass map variable.)\n\nExamples\n\nHere are some representative examples of these classes:\n\n{{}}\n.mt-0 {\n  margin-top: 0 !important;\n}\n\n.ml-1 {\n  margin-left: ($spacer * .25) !important;\n}\n\n.px-2 {\n  padding-left: ($spacer * .5) !important;\n  padding-right: ($spacer * .5) !important;\n}\n\n.p-3 {\n  padding: $spacer !important;\n}\n{{}}\n\nHorizontal centering\n\nAdditionally, Bootstrap also includes an .mx-auto class for horizontally centering fixed-width block level content—that is, content that has display: block and a width set—by setting the horizontal margins to auto.\n\n    Centered element\n\n{{}}\n\n  Centered element\n\n{{}}\n\nNegative margin\n\nIn CSS, margin properties can utilize negative values (padding cannot). As of 4.2, we've added negative margin utilities for every non-zero integer size listed above (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). These utilities are ideal for customizing grid column gutters across breakpoints.\n\nThe syntax is nearly the same as the default, positive margin utilities, but with the addition of n before the requested size. Here's an example class that's the opposite of .mt-1:\n\n{{}}\n.mt-n1 {\n  margin-top: -0.25rem !important;\n}\n{{}}\n\nHere's an example of customizing the Bootstrap grid at the medium (md) breakpoint and above. We've increased the .col padding with .px-md-5 and then counteracted that with .mx-md-n5 on the parent .row.\n\n{{}}\n\n  Custom column padding\n  Custom column padding\n\n{{}}\n",

By doing so the Library will grow and it will become easier to re-use or reference repeating patterns and help the UI become more consistent.\n\nWorking on this library should be fun. The hard work of building it has already been done and the tools have been created to allow you to easily add or edit components. It will allow you to test them on your custom Moodle theme, share them and test them while they are added.\n\nBootstrap docs\n\nA large part of this library contains information about Bootstrap components which are shipped with every Moodle installation. Bootstrap contains a lot of useful components and utilities which can safely be used for frontend development. For example, instead of adding custom CSS to add some padding in a box you should really look at the spacing utilities from Bootstrap instead.\n\nBuild with Hugo\n\nThis page and all other pages in the Component library are build using Hugo, a static site generator that can turn documentation written in Markdown into nice pages like the one you are looking at right now.\n\nUsing npm scripts\n\nThe package.json includes numerous tasks. Run npm run to see all the npm scripts in your terminal. Primary tasks include:\n\n      Task\n      Description\n\n        npm run start\n\n        Run all scripts to create docs, build css, build the search index.\n\n        npm run docs-build\n\n        Rebuild all of the docs pages in admin/tool/componentlibrary/docs\n\n        npm run docs-watch\n\n       Build all docs pages and keep watching for changes in admin/tool/componentlibrary/content\n\n        npm run css-compile\n\n        Compile all scss for these docs pages.\n\n        npm run index\n\n        Index all pages for the search feature\n",
